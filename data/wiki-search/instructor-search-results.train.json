We will explore how films engage with the history and myth of the American West. We will also be analyzing the politics of the Western, in particular how films articulate configurations of race, class, nation, sexuality and gender.

{"name": "Michael V Gluck", "course_descr": "During the period following Stalin\u2019s death known as the Thaw, limited public discussion of the emotional and experiential worlds that had been covered over by Stalin-era Socialist Realism was made possible, even encouraged, by the new Soviet regime. Writing for the desk drawer, for posthumous publication or for publication abroad, was no longer the only option for conscientious writers hoping to reach an audience. Given the opportunity to address a Soviet public that would have never seen their work under Stalin, how did the writers of the Thaw choose to express themselves? What did they feel compelled to say? In response to these questions, this course will survey the diverse forms, styles, themes, and movements that came to prominence between 1953 and 1970. It will examine figures such as Ol\u2019ga Berggol\u2019ts and Ilya Ehrenburg, party members who attempted to salvage the utopian Soviet project from Stalin\u2019s legacy. On the other hand, Village Prose writers began a Russian nationalist movement that threatened the foundations of Communism. Another form, lyric poetry, became a mass sensation during the Thaw, when Evgenii Evtushenko, Andrei Voznesenskii, and Bella Akhmadulina performed their work for increasingly large crowds from Mayakovsky Square in Moscow, to the city\u2019s sports arena, to audiences abroad. Finally, we will consider Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vasilii Grossman, and other chroniclers of the horrors of Stalin\u2019s dictatorship. This course satisfies the Slavic Department\u2019s requirement for a course in Russian literature or culture. No prerequisites.

However, not all feminist anger is received or interpreted in the same way; not all women have had the same freedom to express or represent anger.

How do race, sexuality, gender identity, class, and ethnicity shape who is perceived as \u201cangry\u201d and whose anger is taken seriously? What other affects circulate and interact with anger: from rage and irritation to wonder and joy? We\u2019ll begin with the figure of the \u201cfeminist killjoy,\u201d as theorized by Sara Ahmed and will consider texts by authors including Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, June Jordan, Susan Stryker, and Nella Larsen, alongside manifestos, comics, film, visual art, and zines.\n NOTE: This 4-credit version of First-Year Seminar (FYS)\u2014FYS \u201cWorkshop\u201d\u2014is specially designed for students who believe they would benefit from extra support with their critical reading and academic writing skills.

{"name": "Michael V Gluck", "course_descr": "During the period following Stalin\u2019s death known as the Thaw, limited public discussion of the emotional and experiential worlds that had been covered over by Stalin-era Socialist Realism was made possible, even encouraged, by the new Soviet regime. Writing for the desk drawer, for posthumous publication or for publication abroad, was no longer the only option for conscientious writers hoping to reach an audience. Given the opportunity to address a Soviet public that would have never seen their work under Stalin, how did the writers of the Thaw choose to express themselves? What did they feel compelled to say? In response to these questions, this course will survey the diverse forms, styles, themes, and movements that came to prominence between 1953 and 1970. It will examine figures such as Ol\u2019ga Berggol\u2019ts and Ilya Ehrenburg, party members who attempted to salvage the utopian Soviet project from Stalin\u2019s legacy. On the other hand, Village Prose writers began a Russian nationalist movement that threatened the foundations of Communism. Another form, lyric poetry, became a mass sensation during the Thaw, when Evgenii Evtushenko, Andrei Voznesenskii, and Bella Akhmadulina performed their work for increasingly large crowds from Mayakovsky Square in Moscow, to the city\u2019s sports arena, to audiences abroad. Finally, we will consider Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vasilii Grossman, and other chroniclers of the horrors of Stalin\u2019s dictatorship. This course satisfies the Slavic Department\u2019s requirement for a course in Russian literature or culture. No prerequisites.

Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context.

This course is a practical introduction to computational literary methods which presumes no background in programming or computer science. It is well-suited to humanities students who are interested in experimental methods, and to students in STEM fields who are interested in literary studies. We will cover many of the topics of an introductory course in natural language processing or computational linguistics, but center our inquiries around literary critical questions. We will attempt to answer questions such as:  \u2022 Did Shakespeare really write the plays in the Shakespeare apocrypha?\n \u2022 How can we measure sexual attraction among characters in literary romances?\n \u2022 Are weapons in detective novels typically introduced early or late in the novel?\n \u2022 What words are most frequently used to describe female characters in\u00a0nineteenth century novels?\n \u2022 Who had a richer vocabulary, Charles Dickens or Jane Austen?\n \u2022 What was James Joyce\u2019s favorite color?\n \n The course will teach techniques of text analysis using the Python programming language.

The King of Lanka abducts Rama's wife Sita, and Rama must do everything in his power to find her and bring her home safely. These are the basic plot points of the great Indian epics \nThe Mahabharata\n and the \nRamayana\n. Yet no summarization can do these poems justice, and their stories have been told time and again across genres: they have been re-imagined as novels, serialized on television, condensed into comic books, and performed on stage. In \"Theaters of Gods and Heroes\" we will investigate the many ways that these two epics have been conceived in performance during the last two millennia. For each class, students will read selections of the poems in translation paired with examples of theatrical adaptations that correspond to a given episode. An investigation into adaptation theory, as well as an introduction to the diverse range of performance traditions and theatrical styles that comprise the performing arts in India, this course will cover adaptations of the epics in the classical sanskrit dramatic canon, in ritual performances such as the Ramlila, across regional traditions like the Kudiyattam of Kerala, and in contemporary dramas written since India gained independence in 1947. We will also survey international productions of the epics--such as Peter Brook's \nMahabharata\n (1985) and \nBattlefield\n (2016) and Yael Farber's \nRam: The Abduction of Sita into Darkness\n (2012)-- and address how audience influences dramatic adaptation, as well as what kind of additional work must be done when the epics are taken out of their immediate cultural context. As we work through the many and varied ways the epics have been reimagined in dramatic literature and performance, students will be asked to think about the formal significance of embodiment as a medium as opposed to oral recitation or literary adaptation. How do stories relate differently in performance as opposed to any of the other ways by which the epics could be recapitulated? And, within the range of theatrical adaptations covered by the class, how do we see the same stories shift across different genres or performances?\n", "department": "English and Comparative Literature", "search_results": [{"title": "List of supporting Arrow characters", "snippet": "from John Diggle and Dinah Drake.

Given the opportunity to address a Soviet public that would have never seen their work under Stalin, how did the writers of the Thaw choose to express themselves? What did they feel compelled to say? In response to these questions, this course will survey the diverse forms, styles, themes, and movements that came to prominence between 1953 and 1970. It will examine figures such as Ol\u2019ga Berggol\u2019ts and Ilya Ehrenburg, party members who attempted to salvage the utopian Soviet project from Stalin\u2019s legacy. On the other hand, Village Prose writers began a Russian nationalist movement that threatened the foundations of Communism. Another form, lyric poetry, became a mass sensation during the Thaw, when Evgenii Evtushenko, Andrei Voznesenskii, and Bella Akhmadulina performed their work for increasingly large crowds from Mayakovsky Square in Moscow, to the city\u2019s sports arena, to audiences abroad. Finally, we will consider Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vasilii Grossman, and other chroniclers of the horrors of Stalin\u2019s dictatorship. This course satisfies the Slavic Department\u2019s requirement for a course in Russian literature or culture. No prerequisites. No Russian required.\n", "department": "Slavic Languages", "search_results": [{"title": "Carl Edwards", "snippet": "attend the University of Missouri in his hometown of Columbia.

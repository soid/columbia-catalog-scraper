{"name": "Justin So", "department": "School of Professional Studies (SPS) ", "course_descr": null, "wiki_title": "Justin McCarthy (American historian)", "wiki_page": "Justin A. McCarthy (born October 19, 1945) is an American demographer, professor of history at the University of Louisville, in Louisville, Kentucky. He holds an honorary doctorate from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Turkey, and is a board member of the Institute of Turkish Studies and the Center for Eurasian Studies (AVIM). His area of expertise is the history of the late Ottoman Empire.McCarthy's work has faced harsh criticism by many scholars who have characterized McCarthy's views defending Turkish atrocities against Armenians as genocide denial.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMcCarthy served in the Peace Corps in Turkey, from 1967 to 1969, where he taught at Middle East Technical University and Ankara University. He earned his Ph.D. at University of California, Los Angeles in 1978. He later received an honorary doctorate from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University. McCarthy is also a board member of the Institute of Turkish Studies.\n\n\n== Studies ==\n\n\n=== On Ottoman Empire ===\nMcCarthy's studies concentrate on the period in which the Ottoman Empire crumbled and eventually fell apart. McCarthy believes that orthodox Western histories of the declining Ottoman Empire are biased, since they are based on the testimonies of biased observers: Christian missionaries, and officials of (Christian) nations who were at war with the Ottomans during World War I. Able to read Ottoman Turkish, he focuses on changes in the ethnic composition of local populations. Thus, he has written about the ethnic cleansing of Muslims from  the Balkans and the Caucasus, as well as the Armenian massacres in Anatolia. Scholarly critics of McCarthy acknowledge that his research on Muslim civilian casualties and refugee numbers (19th and early 20th centuries) has brought forth a valuable perspective, previously neglected in the Christian West: that millions of Muslims and Jews also suffered and died during these years. Donald W. Bleacher, though acknowledging that McCarthy is pro-Turkish nonetheless has called Death and Exile \"a necessary corrective\" challenging the West's model of all victims being Christians and all perpetrators as being Muslims.McCarthy's current concentration is on the factors that caused the Ottoman loss in the East in World War I. According to him, the milestone events are the Battle of Sarikamish and what he terms the \"Armenian Revolt\" at Van. Norman Stone praised Justin McCarthy's The Ottoman Turks: \"a brave scholarly attempt, not shrinking from the economic side.\" Similarly, The Ottoman Peoples and the End of Empire was recommended by The History Teacher.McCarthy also worked on the image of the Ottoman Turks, especially in America (The Turk in America), with a focus on the anti-Turkish prejudices disseminated by some missionaries, from the beginning of the 19th century to 1922.\n\n\n=== Armenian Genocide ===\nMcCarthy agrees that a million Armenians died during the massacres of 1915\u20131923, but he argues  that millions of Muslims  in the region were also massacred in this period and many at the \"hands of Armenian insurgents and militia\". He has claimed that all of those deaths during World War I were the product of intercommunal warfare between Turks, Kurds and Armenians, famine and disease, and did not involve an intent or a policy to commit genocide by the Ottoman Empire. McCarthy has been active in publishing the results of his work and analysis, that Ottomans never had an official state sanctioned policy of genocide, through books, articles, conferences, and interviews. This has made him a target of much criticism from historians and organizations.  He was one of four scholars who participated in a controversial debate hosted by PBS about the Armenian Genocide in 2006.   Aviel Roshwald describes McCarthy's \"version of these events\" as \"defensively pro-Turkish.\"Michael M. Gunter congratulated Justin McCarthy for Muslim and Minorities: \"His work is clearly the best available on the subject and merits the close attention of any serious, disinterested scholar\"; and \"his figure\" of the Armenian losses (600,000) \"is probably the most accurate we have.\" Justin McCarthy's work on the demography of Anatolian populations, especially the Armenians, was also recommended by Gilles Veinstein, professor of Ottoman history at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Both Gunter and Veinstein have been accused of holding denialist positions on the Armenian Genocide.\n\n\n== Evaluations ==\nMcCarthy's work has been controversial. The American Historical Review states of Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821\u20131922 (1996):\n\nOne may pick arguments with specific interpretations of events depicted in the work, but the statistical data appear generally valid. McCarthy succeeds in providing factual material for bringing the European historiography of the later Ottoman Empire into more objective balance.\nThe International Journal of Middle East Studies says of the same book: \n\nLike all of the author's other works, this one offers positions that become pivots for rebuttals, disagreements, counter-arguments, different interpretations, and probably some recriminations. Nonetheless, Justin McCarthy's solid demographic work contributes to achieving a better balance and understanding that he so ardently desires for the history of these regions and peoples.\nMcCarthy's work has been the subject of criticism from book reviewers and a number of genocide scholars. According to Israeli historian Yair Auron, McCarthy, \"with Heath Lowry, Lewis' successor in Princeton, leads the list of deniers of the Armenian Genocide.\" \"The Encyclopedia of Genocide\" writes, that Stanford Shaw and McCarthy have published shoddy and desperate books claiming there was no genocide and that \"the Turkish government really treated the Armenians nicely while they were deporting and killing them\", and particularly, \"McCarthy revises demography to suggest that there really weren't many Armenians in historic Armenia\". Among other criticisms, he has been accused by Colin Imber of following a Turkish nationalistic agenda. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Human Rights\", in their efforts to negate the genocidal nature of the event, Lewis, Shaw, McCarthy and Lewy, most notably, \"have ignored the evidence and conclusions of the massive record of documents and decades of scholarship\" as well as the 1948 UN Genocide Convention's definition, and these \"denialist scholars have engaged in what is called unethical practice\". The historian Mark Mazower considers McCarthy's sources and, in particular, his statistics to be \"less balanced\" than those of other historians working in this area. McCarthy is a member of, and has received grants from, the Institute of Turkish Studies. According to historian Richard G. Hovannisian, Stanford Shaw, Heath Lowry and Justin McCarthy all use arguments similar to those found in Holocaust denial.According to Michael Mann McCarthy is often viewed as a scholar on the Turkish side of the debate over Balkan Muslim death figures. Mann however states that even if those figures were reduced \"by as much as 50 percent, they still would horrify\".\n\n\n=== International Association of Genocide Scholars ===\nThe International Association of Genocide Scholars criticised both Justin McCarthy and the Political Scientist Guenter Lewy with the statement \"Scholars who dispute that what happened to the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 constitutes genocide blatantly ignore the overwhelming historical and scholarly evidence. Most recently, this is the case with the works of Mr. Justin McCarthy and Mr. Guenter Lewy, whose books engage in severely selective scholarship that grossly distorts history\". Among the members of the IAGS who voiced concerns were Donald Bloxham, a University of Edinburgh historian specializing in genocide studies, who acknowledges that \"McCarthy's work has something to offer in drawing attention to the oft-unheeded history of Muslim suffering and embattlement... It also shows that vicious nationalism was by no means the sole preserve\" of the Ottoman ruling elite. Nevertheless, he identifies McCarthy's work in this field as part of a wider project of undermining scholarship affirming the Armenian Genocide, by reducing it to something analogous to a population exchange. Bloxham writes that McCarthy's work \"[serves] to muddy the waters for external observers, conflating war and one-sided murder with various discrete episodes of ethnic conflict... [A] series of easy get-out clauses for Western politicians and non-specialist historians keen not to offend Turkish opinion.\" IAGS members Samuel Totten and Steven L. Jacobs write that Shaw's and his adherents' (especially Lowry and McCarthy) publications have \"striking similarities to the arguments used in the denial of the holocaust\": labeling the alleged genocide as a myth by wartime propaganda, portraying the presumed victims as having been real security threats, discounting eye-witness accounts, asserting that deaths occurred were from the same causes that carried away all peoples in the region, minimizing the number of victims, and so on. Likewise, Peter Medding, Professor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, maintains that the number of Armenian Genocide deniers is small (the most prominent being Shaw, McCarthy, Lowry and Lewis) but \"their influence is great by virtue of pernicious alliance with the official campaign of falsification by the government of Turkey\", so the genocide scholars \"have been required to spend much of their intellectual energy on refuting the claims of pseudo-scholarship\".\n\n\n=== Armenian Assembly of America ===\nThe Armenian Assembly of America has stated that McCarthy lent support to the Assembly of Turkish American Associations, which led an effort to defeat recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1985.\n\n\n=== The Executive Council of Australian Jewry and Australian Federal Parliament ===\nIn November 2013, three planned meetings at the Australian Federal Parliament, University of Melbourne and Art Gallery of New South Wales were canceled on the grounds of opposition to McCarthy's academic stances and due to pressure from groups who claimed that his view that there was no systematic and deliberate effort by the Ottoman Empire to wipe out populations amounts to genocide denial.\n\n\n== Works ==\nMcCarthy, Justin (1982).

Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts.\nCarpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Come On Come On, which yielded seven charting country singles and was certified quadruple platinum in the US for sales exceeding four million copies. She followed it with Stones in the Road (1994) and A Place in the World (1996), which both featured hit singles. In the 2000s, Carpenter's albums departed both thematically and musically from her early work, becoming less radio-friendly and more focused on societal and political issues. In 2007, she released The Calling. She followed that with The Age of Miracles (2010), Ashes and Roses (2012) and the orchestral album, Songs From the Movie (2014).\nCarpenter has won five Grammy Awards and is the only artist to have won four consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, which she received from 1992 to 1995. She has sold more than 12 million records worldwide. On October 7, 2012, Carpenter was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nCarpenter has performed on television shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and Austin City Limits and on radio shows such as The Diane Rehm Show. She also tours frequently, returning to Washington almost every summer to perform at Wolf Trap.\nShe is a direct descendant of Deacon Samuel Chapin, United States Chief Justice John Marshall and a fifth cousin of the late singer and humanitarian Harry Chapin (along with his brothers Tom and Steve).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nCarpenter was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to Chapin Carpenter Jr., a Life Magazine executive, and Mary Bowie Robertson. She was the fourth great-granddaughter of the 4th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States John Marshall through her maternal grandfather Harrison Marshall Robertson. She was also an eleventh great-granddaughter of Mayflower passengers Francis Cooke and Richard Warren, both through her maternal grandfather Harrison Marshall Robertson. Carpenter lived in Japan from 1969 to 1971 before moving to Washington, D.C. She attended Princeton Day School, a private coeducational prep school, before graduating from The Taft School in 1976.Carpenter described her childhood as \"pretty typical suburban\", with her musical interests defined chiefly by her sisters' albums of artists such as The Mamas & the Papas, The Beatles, and Judy Collins. When Carpenter was 16 her parents divorced, an event that affected Carpenter and that she wrote about in her song \"House of Cards\". Carpenter spent much of her time in high school playing the guitar and piano; while at Princeton Day School, her \"classmates threatened to cut her guitar strings if she played 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' one more time.\" Despite her interest in music, Carpenter never considered performing publicly until, shortly after graduating from Taft, her father suggested that she perform at a local open-mic bar, a stressful experience for the shy Carpenter, who recalled, \"I thought I was going to barf.\" Carpenter also hosted an open-mic night at a bar in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, DC for a number of years.Carpenter graduated from Brown University in 1981 with a degree in American Civilization. Carpenter played some summer sets in Washington's music scene, where she met guitarist John Jennings, who would become her producer and long-time collaborator. However, she considered music a hobby and planned on getting a \"real job\". She briefly quit performing, but after several job interviews decided to return to music. Carpenter was persuaded by Jennings to play original material instead of covers. Within a few years, she landed a manager and recorded a demo tape that led to a deal with Columbia Records.\n\n\n=== Early records and \"country\" label ===\nCarpenter's first album, \"Hometown Girl\"  was produced by John Jennings and was released in 1987. Though songs from Hometown Girl got play on public and college radio stations, it was not until Columbia began promoting Carpenter as a \"country\" artist that she found a wider audience. For a long time, Carpenter was ambivalent about this pigeonholing, saying she preferred the term \"singer-songwriter\" or \"slash rocker\" (as in country/folk/rock). She told Rolling Stone in 1991, \"I've never approached music from a categorization process, so to be a casualty of it is real disconcerting to me\".Some music critics argue that Carpenter's style covers a range of influences even broader than those from \"country\" and \"folk\". Time critic Richard Corliss described the songs in her album A Place in the World as \"reminiscent of early Beatles or rollicking Motown\", and one reviewer of Time* Sex* Love* noted the \"wash of Beach Boys-style harmonies ... backwards guitar loops\" and use of a sitar on one track, all elements not commonly found on a country or folk album.\nAfter 1989's State of the Heart, Carpenter released Shooting Straight in the Dark in 1990, which yielded her biggest single up to that point, the Grammy Award-winning \"Down at the Twist and Shout\". Two years later, Carpenter released the album that, to date, has been her biggest popular success, Come On Come On (1992). The album went quadruple platinum, remaining on the Country Top 100 list for more than 97 weeks, and eventually spawned seven charting singles. Come On Come On was also critically acclaimed; The New York Times's Karen Schoemer wrote that Carpenter had \"risen through the country ranks without flash or bravado: no big hair, sequined gowns, teary performances.... Enriched with Ms. Carpenter's subtlety, Come On Come On grows stronger and prettier with every listen.\"The songs of Come On Come On had the qualities that would come to identify her work: humorous, fast-paced country-rock songs with themes of perseverance, desire, and independence, alternating with slow, introspective ballads that speak to social or relational issues. \"Passionate Kisses\", a cover of fellow singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams's 1988 song, was the album's third single. Carpenter's version peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No. 4, and was the first of Carpenter's songs to cross over to mainstream pop and adult contemporary charts, charting at No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 11 on Adult Contemporary.The sixth single on Come On Come On, \"He Thinks He'll Keep Her\", was Carpenter's biggest hit off the album, charting at No. 2 on Billboard's Country chart and at No. 1 on Radio & Records's Country chart. Written by Carpenter and Don Schlitz, the fast-paced song follows a 36-year-old homemaker who leaves her husband, and was inspired by a 1970s series of Geritol commercials in which a man boasts of his wife's seemingly limitless energy and her many accomplishments, then concludes by saying, \"My wife ... I think I'll keep her.\" Carpenter said, \"That line has always stuck with me. It's just such a joke.\" The single received a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year.\n\n\n=== Continued 1990s success ===\nIn the wake of Come On Come On's success, Carpenter wrote songs for a variety of artists, including Joan Baez, who recorded \"Stones in the Road\" for her 1992 album Play Me Backwards after hearing Carpenter sing it live. She also wrote Tony Rice's song \"John Wilkes Booth\" for his 1988 album \"Native American\". Pop singer Cyndi Lauper co-wrote \"Sally's Pigeons\" with Carpenter and released it on her 1993 album Hat Full of Stars.  Country singer Wynonna Judd recorded Carpenter's composition \"Girls with Guitars\" on her 1993 album Tell Me Why. Judd released the song as a single in 1994, in what Carpenter called \"the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me as a songwriter\", and it peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No. 10.Later, Carpenter co-wrote \"Where Are You Now\", which Trisha Yearwood recorded on her 2000 album Real Live Woman; the song peaked on the Country chart at No. 45. In the 1990s, Carpenter also duetted with Shawn Colvin, a \"longtime recording pal\" (the two frequently appeared on one-another's albums), and sang backup in Radney Foster's \"Nobody Wins\", Dolly Parton (on Parton's 1993 singles \"Romeo\" & \"More Where That Came From\"), and Joan Baez on a 1995 live recording of \"Diamonds & Rust\". Carpenter also performed a number of concerts with Baez and the Indigo Girls as The Four Voices, during the mid- to late-1990s.\nCarpenter followed Come On Come On with 1994's Stones in the Road, at which point USA Today wrote, \"without sounding anything like a country star was previously expected to sound, [Carpenter]'s one of the genre's biggest stars.\" Stones in the Road sold only around two million copies, but yielded three charting singles with Shut Up and Kiss Me reaching number on the Billboard Country Charts and was a crossover success with non-country audiences. Also in 1994, Carpenter contributed the song \"Willie Short\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. Carpenter's sixth album, A Place in the World, was released in 1996 to \"raves\" from publications as varied as Time, People, Elle, the New York Post, and USA Today. The Boston Globe found the album more \"philosophical [and] heady\" than her previous work, and quoted Carpenter as saying, \"[A]ll I've wanted to get out of songwriting is a sense of growth.... I'm not shying away from any issues or subjects. I don't feel there's anything I can't address.\"In 1996, Carpenter's cover of the John Lennon song \"Grow Old With Me\", from the Lennon tribute album Working Class Hero, became an Adult Contemporary chart hit. The song \"10,000 Miles\" was the signature track in the 1996 family film Fly Away Home.In 1998, Carpenter was signed to write the music and lyrics for a planned Broadway musical adaptation of the 1953 western film Shane. Producers proposed Shane to Carpenter after Dolly Parton, and then Garth Brooks, left the project. According to Carpenter, the producers singled out \"songs like 'I Am a Town' and 'John Doe No. 24,' songs that are story songs, very character-driven, as the key that made them want to see if this was something I was interested in. I was surprised by that, and intrigued.\" Carpenter left the project in 2000.\n\n\n=== 2000s and beyond work ===\nIn 2001, Carpenter released her first studio album in five years, Time*Sex*Love. The New York Times wrote that Carpenter was \"harder than ever to define stylistically\", and described the album as a departure, \"essentially a concept album about middle age\". In songs such as \"The Long Way Home\", Carpenter espoused taking life at one's own pace, rather than indulging in rampant goal-driven materialism.\nTime*Sex*Love sold fewer copies than Carpenter's earlier work, and yielded only one charting single, \"Simple Life\", which peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No. 53. Carpenter explained that, \"When the record was released, I really believed there were several radio-friendly songs ... it has been since proven to me that is not exactly the case.\"In 2004, Carpenter released Between Here and Gone, a somber album that addressed events such as the events of September 11 and the death of singer-songwriter Dave Carter. The album received some of the best reviews of Carpenter's career.\nCarpenter's ninth studio album, The Calling, was released in 2007 by Rounder Records' rock/pop imprint Zo\u00eb and featured commentary about contemporary politics, including reactions to the impact of Hurricane Katrina (\"Houston\") and the agreement with the Dixie Chicks (\"On With the Song\"). In less than three months after its release, The Calling sold more than 100,000 copies in the US, without benefit of any substantial airplay on commercial country radio. This was followed by a Christmas album, Come Darkness, Come Light, which mixed original and traditional material, also on the Zo\u00eb label.Carpenter's tenth studio album, The Age of Miracles was released on April 27, 2010. It debuted at No. 28, her highest peak since 1996.\nIn late 2011, Carpenter announced via Facebook and Twitter that she was hard at work on a follow-up album to The Age of Miracles. The beginning recording sessions were recorded at AIR Studios in London, England.\nOn February 14, 2012, Carpenter announced via her management on her official Facebook page, that her new album, Ashes and Roses, would be released on June 12, 2012.\nIn October 2013, Carpenter's management announced that she would release her debut orchestral recording with Songs from the Movie on January 14, 2014. On Jan 24 she performed the album songs at the Celtic Connections Festival in the Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, Scotland with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.\nIn early 2018, Carpenter released Sometimes Just the Sky.  With one new cut on the album, the rest is a re-recording of one song from each of her twelve studio albums, all with a new band and some different arrangements. Carpenter says the title track is inspired from an interview with Patti Smith in which Smith said \u2013 \"You don't have to look far or wide, and it doesn't have to be complicated or expensive or madness to find things to soothe you in life, or to be happy about. Sometimes just the sky makes everything fall into perspective.\"\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nDespite a series of relationships, including one with John Jennings, the media made much of Carpenter's single status throughout the 90s; in a 1994 profile, Entertainment Weekly even dubbed her \"a spokes-singer for the thirtysomething single woman\".In 2002 Carpenter married contractor Tim Smith. They divorced in 2010.Throughout her career, she has actively supported various charities, including CARE and Habitat for Humanity, and has conducted fundraising concerts for such causes as the elimination of landmines.\nCarpenter has struggled with periods of depression since childhood. While on tour with her album The Calling in spring 2007, Carpenter experienced severe chest and back pain. She continued to perform until a bout of breathlessness took her to the ER, where she learned she had suffered a pulmonary embolism. Cancelling her summer tour to recover, Carpenter \"felt that [she] had let everyone down\" and fell into a depression before rediscovering \"the learning curve of gratitude\". Carpenter spoke about the experience on National Public Radio's This I Believe program in June 2007.\nCarpenter was the author of a biweekly column in The Washington Times from December 2008 to March 2009 in which she discussed topics related to music and politics.Carpenter lives near Batesville, Virginia.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAcademy of Country Music\n\n1990 Top New Female Vocalist\n1992 Top Female VocalistAmericana Music Honors & Awards\n\n2010 Spirit of Americana/Free Speech AwardCountry Music Association\n\n1992 Female Vocalist of the Year\n1993 Female Vocalist of the YearGrammy Awards\n\n1992 Best Country Vocal Performance, Female \u2013 \"Down at the Twist and Shout\"\n1993 Best Country Vocal Performance, Female \u2013 \"I Feel Lucky\"\n1994 Best Country Vocal Performance, Female \u2013 \"Passionate Kisses\"\n1995 Best Country Album \u2013 \"Stones in the Road\"\n1995 Best Country Vocal Performance, Female \u2013 \"Shut Up and Kiss Me\"Honorary Degree\n\n1996 Brown University\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMary Chapin Carpenter official web site\nComprehensive Mary Chapin Carpenter Discography\nMary Chapin Carpenter on IMDb", "label": 0}

He was the joint winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with John Hicks in 1972.\nIn economics, he was a major figure in post-World War II neo-classical economic theory. Many of his former graduate students have gone on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize themselves. His most significant works are his contributions to social choice theory, notably \"Arrow's impossibility theorem\", and his work on general equilibrium analysis. He has also provided foundational work in many other areas of economics, including endogenous growth theory and the economics of information.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nArrow was born on 23 August 1921, in New York City. Arrow's mother, Lilian (Greenberg), was from Ia\u0219i, Romania, and his father, Harry Arrow, was from nearby Podu Iloaiei. The Arrow family were Romanian Jews. His family was very supportive of his education. Growing up during the Great Depression, he embraced socialism in his youth. He would later move away from socialism, but his views retained a left-leaning philosophy.He graduated from Townsend Harris High School and then earned a Bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1940 in mathematics, where he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon.  He attended Columbia University, for his graduate studies. While there, he studied under Harold Hotelling, and was greatly influenced by him. He received a Master's degree in 1941. He served as a weather officer in the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1946.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nFrom 1946 to 1949 Arrow spent his time partly as a graduate student at Columbia and partly as a research associate at the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago. During that time he also held the rank of Assistant Professor in Economics at the University of Chicago and worked at the RAND Corporation in California. He left Chicago to take up the post of Acting Assistant Professor of Economics and Statistics at Stanford University. In 1951, he earned his PhD from Columbia. He served in the government on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers in the 1960s with Robert Solow. In 1968, he left Stanford for the position of Professor of Economics at Harvard University. It was during his tenure there that he received the Nobel Prize in Economics.Arrow returned to Stanford in 1979 and became the Joan Kenney Professor of Economics and Professor of Operations Research. He retired in 1991. As a Fulbright Distinguished Chair, in 1995 he taught Economics at the University of Siena. He was also a founding member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and a member of the Science Board of Santa Fe Institute. At various stages in his career he was a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge.Five of his former students have gone on to become Nobel Prize winners. These include Eric Maskin, John Harsanyi, Michael Spence and Roger Myerson. A collection of Arrow's papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.\n\n\n=== Arrow's impossibility theorem ===\n\nArrow's monograph Social Choice and Individual Values derives from his 1951 PhD thesis.\n\nIf we exclude the possibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility, then the only methods of passing from individual tastes to social preferences which will be satisfactory and which will be defined for a wide range of sets of individual orderings are either imposed or dictatorial.\nIn what he named the General Impossibility Theorem, he theorized that it was impossible to formulate a social preference ordering that satisfies all of the following conditions:\nNondictatorship: The preferences of an individual should not become the group ranking without considering the preferences of others.\nIndividual Sovereignty: each individual should be able to order the choices in any way and indicate ties\nUnanimity: If every individual prefers one choice to another, then the group ranking should do the same\nFreedom From Irrelevant Alternatives: If a choice is removed, then the others' order should not change\nUniqueness of Group Rank: The method should yield the same result whenever applied to a set of preferences.  The group ranking should be transitive.The theorem has implications for welfare economics and theories of justice. It was extended by Amartya Sen to the liberal paradox which argued that given a status of \"Minimal Liberty\" there was no way to obtain Pareto optimality, nor to avoid the problem of social choice of neutral but unequal results.\n\n\n=== General equilibrium theory ===\n\nWork by Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu and simultaneous work by Lionel McKenzie offered the first rigorous proofs of the existence of a market clearing equilibrium. For this work and his other contributions, Debreu won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Economics. Arrow went on to extend the model and its analysis to include uncertainty, the stability. His contributions to the general equilibrium theory were strongly influenced by Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. Written in 1776, The Wealth of Nations is an examination of economic growth brought forward by the division of labor, by ensuring interdependence of individuals within society.In 1974, The American Economic Association published the paper written by Kenneth Arrow, General Economic Equilibrium: Purpose, Analytic Techniques, Collective Choice, where he states:\n\nFrom the time of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations in 1776, one recurrent theme of economic analysis has been the remarkable degree of coherence among the vast numbers of individual and seemingly separate decisions about the buying and selling of commodities. In everyday, normal experience, there is something of a balance between the amounts of goods and services that some individuals want to supply and the amounts that other, different individuals want to sell. Would-be buyers ordinarily count correctly on being able to carry out their intentions, and would-be sellers do not ordinarily find themselves producing great amounts of goods that they cannot sell. This experience of balance indeed so widespread that it raises no intellectual disquiet among laymen; they take it so much for granted that they are not supposed to understand the mechanism by which it occurs.\n\n\n=== Fundamental theorems of welfare economics ===\nIn 1951, Arrow presented the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics and their proofs without requiring differentiability of utility, consumption, or technology, and including corner solutions.\n\n\n=== Endogenous-growth theory ===\n\nArrow was one of the precursors of endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain the source of technical change, which is a key driver of economic growth. Until this theory came to prominence, technical change was assumed to occur exogenously \u2013 that is, it was assumed to occur outside economic activities, and was outside (exogenous) to common economic models. At the same time there was no economic explanation for why it occurred. Endogenous-growth theory provided standard economic reasons for why firms innovate, leading economists to think of innovation and technical change as determined by economic actors, that is endogenously to economic activities, and thus belong inside the model. Endogenous growth theory started with Paul Romer's 1986 paper, borrowing from Arrow's 1962 \"learning-by-doing\" model which introduced a mechanism to eliminate diminishing returns in aggregate output. A literature on this theory has developed subsequently to Arrow's work.\n\n\n=== Information economics ===\nIn other pioneering research, Arrow investigated the problems caused by asymmetric information in markets. In many transactions, one party (usually the seller) has more information about the product being sold than the other party. Asymmetric information creates incentives for the party with more information to cheat the party with less information; as a result, a number of market structures have developed, including warranties and third party authentication, which enable markets with asymmetric information to function. Arrow analysed this issue for medical care (a 1963 paper entitled \"Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care\", in the American Economic Review); later researchers investigated many other markets, particularly second-hand assets, online auctions and insurance.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nArrow was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal in 1957 and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959. He was the joint winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with John Hicks in 1972 and the 1986 recipient of the von Neumann Theory Prize. He was one of the recipients of the 2004 National Medal of Science, the nation's highest scientific honor, presented by President George W. Bush for his contributions to research on the problem of making decisions using imperfect information and his research on bearing risk.He has received honorary doctorates from the University of Chicago (1967), the University of Vienna (1971) the City University of New York (1972). On 2 June 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2006.\nHe was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nArrow was a brother to the economist Anita Summers, uncle to economist and former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers, and brother-in-law of the late economists Robert Summers and Paul Samuelson. In 1947, he married Selma Schweitzer, graduate in economics at the University of Chicago and psychotherapist, who died in 2015; they had two children: David Michael (b. 1962), an actor, and Andrew Seth (b. 1965)an actor/singer.Arrow was well known for being a polymath, possessing prodigious knowledge of subjects far removed from economics. On one occasion (recounted by Eric Maskin), in an attempt to artificially test Arrow's knowledge, the junior faculty agreed to closely study the breeding habits of gray whales \u2013 a suitably obscure topic \u2013 and discuss it in his presence. To their surprise, Arrow actually joined into the conversation.Arrow died in his Palo Alto, California home on 21 February 2017 at the age of 95.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEric S.

{"name": "William Cobb", "department": "Journalism", "course_descr": null, "wiki_title": "William Montague Cobb", "wiki_page": "William Montague Cobb (1904\u20131990) was a board-certified physician and a physical anthropologist. As the first African American Ph.D in anthropology, and the only one until after the Korean War, his main focus in the anthropological discipline was studying the idea of race and its negative impact  on communities of color.  His career both as a physician and a  professor at Howard University was dedicated to the advancement of African American researchers and he was heavily involved in civil rights activism. Cobb wrote prolifically and contributed both popular and scholarly articles during the course of his career. His work has been noted as a significant contribution to the development of the sub-discipline of biocultural anthropology during the first half of the 20th Century. Cobb was also an accomplished educator and taught over 5000 students in the social and health sciences during his lifetime.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nCobb was born on October 12, 1904, in Washington DC. His mother, Alexizne Montague Cobb grew up in Massachusetts and is partly of Native American descent. His father, William Elmer Cobb, grew up in Selma, Alabama. His parents met in Washington DC when his father started his own printing business for the Black community.\nThe tipping point for Cobb's initial interest in Anthropology came from a book of the animal kingdom that his grandfather owned. In this book, there were illustrations of human beings separated by race, but were illustrated with what Cobb called \"equal dignity.\" This lead to an interest on the concept of race, as the same type of \"equal dignity\" was not granted in the society that surrounded Cobb's life.Cobb attended Dunbar High School, a highly esteemed Washington, DC. African American high school in 1917. He was a successful student and athlete, and went on to win championships in cross-country as well as lightweight and welterweight boxing during his high school and collegiate years. He married Hilda B. Smith, Ruth Smith Lloyd's sister, and they had two children. Cobb died of pneumonia on November 20, 1990 at the age of 86.\n\n\n== Education ==\nFollowing his graduation from Dunbar High School in 1921, Cobb earned his Bachelor of Arts from Amherst College in 1925. Following completion of his baccalaureate degree, he received a Blodgett Scholarship for proficiency in biology which allowed him to pursue research in embryology at Woods Hole Marine Biology Laboratory. He earned his MD (Doctor of Medicine) in 1929 from the Howard University Medical School. He worked jobs throughout his time in medical school. Cobb then accepted a position at Howard University which he was offered prior to his graduation. Numa P.G. Adams, who was the Dean of Howard University at the time, was assigned the task of organizing a new faculty of African American physicians to help advance the school in the medical field. Cobb, in turn had the aspirations of creating a laboratory of anatomy and physical anthropology at Howard University that would have the resources for African American scholars to contribute to debates in racial biology. As a part of Dean Adams' efforts, Cobb was sent to study under biological anthropologist T. Wingate Todd at Case Western Reserve University. Cobb's dissertation work was an expansive survey of the Hamann-Todd Skeletal Collection, a large skeletal population now housed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History which is associated with Case Western Reserve University. He earned his Ph.D in Anthropology in 1932 and his dissertation was published the title Human Archives the following year.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing the conferral of his doctorate, Cobb remained at Case Western Reserve University as a fellow, where he continued work on the Hamman-Todd Collection with a focus on cranial suture closure. His 1940 publication \"Cranio-Facial Union in Man\" produced as a result of this work established his expertise as a functional anatomist and is one of his most widely cited works to date. During this period, Cobb also worked with physical anthropologist Ale\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka on a survey of the skeletal collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. He returned to the Howard University Medical School in 1930 where he taught for the majority of his career and established the W. Montague Cobb Skeletal Collection. He became the university's first distinguished professor in 1969 and became professor emeritus in 1973. In addition to his work at Howard, Cobb also taught at Stanford University, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, the University of Washington, the University of Maryland, West Virginia University, Harvard Medical School, the Medical College of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, and the Catholic University of America during his lifetime.Cobb was heavily involved with a number of anthropological and medical organizations during his career. He was an active member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists since its second meeting in 1930 and served on its board on multiple occasions, both as its vice president (from 1948-50 and from 1954-56) and president (from 1957-59). He also held leadership roles with the Anthropological Society of Washington, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Eugenics Society, and the Medico-Chirurgical Society of the District of Columbia. He also served as chairman on the Council of Medical Education and Hospitals for two terms (1948-63).Throughout his lifetime Cobb pursued work aimed at furthering the opportunities of African Americans both within society in general and within the health sciences. He was an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and served as its president from 1976-1982. He created the Imhotep Conferences on Hospital Integration in 1957 as a part of the NAACP, an annual conference seeking to end hospital and medical school segregation that continued until 1964. He was an active member of the National Medical Association, an organization dedicated to the advancement of African American physicians and other health professionals. He was a longtime contributor to its journal, the Journal of the National Medical Association, to which he served as editor from 1944 to his death in 1990. He also served as the organization's president from 1964-65. In addition to his involvement in both African American and European American-led professional organizations and journals, Cobb was active in community outreach through work on race and health published in popular African American magazines such as Negro Digest, Pittsburgh Courier, and Ebony.\n\n\n== Scholarship ==\nThroughout his career, Cobb applied his technical expertise in functional anatomy and medicine to a variety of topics, including the issues of African American health, child development, and disproving scientific justifications for racism. His approach has been characterized as a form of applied anthropology and activist scholarship. His work explicitly critiqued hierarchical understandings of human variation, and he often subverted racist evolutionary arguments through highlighting the resiliency of African Americans. He took as an example the experience of the Transatlantic slave trade which he argued acted as a selective pressure and would have led to a genetically stronger population relative to European  Americans who did not experience this population bottleneck. Cobb often used his expertise in anatomy and biology in order to combat racist explanations for perceived differences between African Americans and European Americans. One of the most widely-cited studies in this effort was Cobb's \"Race and Runners,\" published in 1936. In this work, Cobb took the case of Jesse Owens to dispel the idea that his success as a quadruple gold medal winner could be explained by his \" African American genes,\" an argument that stemmed from the idea that black people were stronger and more athletic than whites at the cost of decreased intelligence. Proponents of this idea often pointed to the supposed existence of extra musculature or differences in nerve thicknesses that allowed African American athletes to excel relative to European Americans. Cobb addressed this question by surveying the anatomical characteristics of Owens as well as other prominent African Americans in different sports. Cobb demonstrated that not only could their successes not be explained by a shared racial trait, the physiology that would make a superior athlete in one sport would be very different from another. Instead, Cobb accounted for the achievements of African American athletes relative to European Americans in sports as due to \"training and incentive\" rather than any \"special physical endowment\".During the latter years of his career, Cobb took a more philosophical approach to his anatomical perspective of humanity. He often used biological metaphors to point to key issues within society. Cobb's most prominent philosophical contribution was arguably his 1975 publication, \"An anatomist's view of human relations. Homo sanguinis versus Homo sapiens--mankind's present dilemma\". This work focused primarily on the fundamental conflict in human nature he described as being between the civilized people suggested by our binomial designation Homo sapiens (\"Man the Wise\") and the much older and violent organism he described via his coined term Homo sanguinus (\"Man the bloody\"). Cobb described the recent \"adaptations\" of civilization and ethics as similar to recently-evolved anatomical traits like bipedalism, a key human trait which has nonetheless resulted in a host of health conditions due to our lineage's adaptations for quadrupedal locomotion. Cobb argued that man the wise is up against the ancient evolutionary tradition of man as a \"bloody, predatory primate\" and that this history of violence and hatred will thus be difficult to overcome. Cobb's final presented publication in 1988, \"Human Variation: Informing the Public,\" applied his Homo sanguinus more closely to the rapid cultural change of the late 20th Century. Cobb saw this period of rapid development as both a key opportunity for continued progress against racism and other forms of inequality and a potential for such issues to become more firmly embedded within the system of the society: \"Just as an embryological defect cannot be corrected, so our mammoth construction programs can be wrong, which is not obvious until it is too late.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nCobb distinguished himself by representing the pursuit of social responsibility in the field of anthropology, as well as by being an activist scholar who often applied anthropological methods to issues of racism and inequality. He undertook studies within the scope of his expertise in anatomy that aimed at disproving racist explanations for social difference.He believed that scholars must take responsibility \"not only for their own thoughts and actions but also for their own society\" because the values that are expressed in scientific work, whether subtly or overtly, are key in the shaping of culture and society. He was one of the first anthropologist to undertake a demographic analysis that illustrated the consequences of segregation and racism on the African American population, and he wanted to create the resources so he would not be the last. One of Cobb's greatest contributions to this end is the expansive skeletal collection he curated during his time at Howard University which is now housed at the university's W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, a research laboratory led by biological anthropologist Fatimah Jackson that also houses the New York African Burial Ground collection.Cobb was long involved in African descendants' struggle for freedom, justice, and equality.  He assumed a number of roles in African American-led organizations, including the National Urban League and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, and he was a longtime editor of the first African American medical journal, the Journal of the National Medical Association.  He was a member of the board of directors for the NAACP from 1949 until his death and president from 1976 to 1982.  Cobb played a key role in efforts to expand access to medical care through his active leadership in the National Medical Association, and this activism led to his testimony to congress during the hearings leading up to the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. He was present at the signing of this bill into law by invitation of President Lyndon B. Johnson.During his lifetime, Cobb was honored by over 100 organizations for his efforts as a scholar and as an activist, including the American Association of Anatomy's highest award, the Henry Gray Award, which he received for his outstanding contributions in the field in 1980. He was also the recipient of the U.S. Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award and received honorary doctorates from several institutions, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, Georgetown University, the University of the Witwatersrand, Morgan State University, Howard University, and Amherst College.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nA few of Cobb's most celebrated works were the following:\n\n\"Human Archives\" \u2013 1932.\n\"Race and Runners\" \u20131936.\n\"Cranio Facial Union of Man\" \u2013 1940.\n\"The Cranio-Facial Union and the Maxillary Tuber in Mammals\" \u2013 1943.\n\u201cMedical Care and the Plight of the Negro in Medicine\u201d \u2013 1947.\n\"An anatomist's view of human relations.

His father, Felix Slatkin, was the violinist, conductor and founder of the Hollywood String Quartet, and his mother, Eleanor Aller, was the cellist with the quartet. His brother, Frederick, now a cellist, traced the family's original name as Zlotkin, and adopted that form of the family surname for himself professionally.  Frederick Zlotkin has spoken of the family lineage as follows:\n\n\"The Zlotkin/Slatkin lineage is Russian-Jewish. The first Zlotkin arrival to the US was Felix's father, grandpa Chaim Peretz Zlotkin, who came to settle with relatives in St. Louis in 1904; he (or the clerk at Ellis Island) changed the name.  He probably came from the town of Mogilev [now Mohyliv-Podilskyi], from a shtetl (the Russians forced most Jews to live in villages outside of the major cities)...The Altschuler [Aller] side of the family is really rife with musicians. [My grandfather] Grisha's uncle, Modest Altschuler, was a cellist (making me 4th generation) and he had quite a career. Among other things, he did the St. Petersburg premiere of Tchaikovsky's Souvenir de Florence Sextet. When he came to America he formed the Russian Symphony Orchestra (early 1900s).\"Slatkin studied at Indiana University and Los Angeles City College before attending the Juilliard School where he studied conducting under Jean Morel. He also studied with Walter Susskind at the Aspen Music Festival and School.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHis conducting debut was in 1966 when he became artistic director and conductor of the award-winning New York Youth Symphony, and in 1968, Walter Susskind named him the assistant conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. While in St. Louis, Slatkin hosted for three years a weekly KDNA radio station program called The Slatkin Project. He left St. Louis in 1977 to become music director of the New Orleans Symphony.\nHe led a series of Beethoven festivals with the San Francisco Symphony during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  These annual concerts, held during June, included the orchestra's final concert in San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House in 1980, which featured a performance of Beethoven's ninth symphony.\nSlatkin returned to Saint Louis in 1979 as music director of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. The national profile of the orchestra increased notably under his tenure, and the SLSO became one of the most acclaimed orchestras in the country. The ensemble toured and recorded frequently, and impressed critics and audiences alike with its fine musicianship and creative musical direction. In 1985, he recorded the first digital stereo version of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker with the SLSO. (This was also the first complete Nutcracker issued on compact disc.)  Upon the conclusion of his tenure in 1996, he became the SLSO's conductor laureate.  His recorded work with that orchestra was represented on RCA Victor Red Seal, EMI,  Vox Records, and Telarc. Slatkin became a devoted fan of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team during his tenure in St Louis, and has retained his interest in the Cardinals since his departure from St Louis.Slatkin was the director of the Blossom Festival of the Cleveland Orchestra from 1990 to 1999.  Slatkin was music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. from 1996 to 2008.  Noted for putting the \u201cnational\u201d back in National Symphony with programs highlighting twentieth-century American works, Slatkin received both praise for improving the overall quality of the orchestra and criticism for under-rehearsal of the NSO.In 2000, Slatkin became the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.  In 2001, he was only the second non-British person to conduct the Last Night of the Proms (the first had been an Australian, Sir Charles Mackerras). This performance occurred in the wake of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, and included changes to the traditional second half of the concert, most notably a performance of the Barber Adagio for Strings in honor of the victims.  He held this post until September 11, 2004, the 110th Last Night.  There were reports of tension between Slatkin and the orchestra, whose secure finances were said to have \"fostered a culture of superiority and recalcitrance,\" as well as negative concert reviews, which contributed to his short tenure with the BBCSO. Previously in the UK, Slatkin was principal guest conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra from 1997 to 2000 and made a series of digital recordings for RCA with them, including the symphonies of Ralph Vaughan Williams. In 2004, the Los Angeles Philharmonic named him principal guest conductor at the Hollywood Bowl for a two-year period; he was subsequently given a third year in the position, with his tenure ending in September 2007.  In 2005, he became the principal guest conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London.\nIn 2006, Slatkin was named the music advisor to the Nashville Symphony Orchestra.  In that capacity, he conducted the inaugural concert of the Schermerhorn Symphony Center on September 9, 2006.  In June 2007, Slatkin was announced as the next Principal Guest Conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and he assumed this post in 2008.  On October 27, 2006, the Jacobs School of Music announced the appointment of Slatkin to the faculty at Indiana University as a part-time teacher of conducting and composition.\nOn October 7, 2007, Slatkin announced he had reached agreement on a three-year contract, followed by a two-year option, to become the new music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, beginning with the 2008-2009 subscription season. Slatkin stated that he would relocate to the Detroit area.  His contract in Detroit called for 5 weeks of subscription concerts in the 2008-2009 season, and 13 weeks in the 2009-2010 season.  Slatkin conducted his first concert as music director in Detroit in December 2008.  In February 2010, the orchestra announced the extension of Slatkin's contract as music director through the 2012-2013 season.  This also included an announcement that Slatkin would take a salary reduction to help relieve the financial difficulties of the orchestra.  In November 2011, the orchestra announced the extension of Slatkin's Detroit contract through the 2015-2016 season. In December 2014, the DSO announced the extension of his contract through August 2017, when it then becomes year-to-year. Slatkin stated that the projected year-to-year part of the contract did not mean that he planned to leave, only that at his age \"it makes more sense to stay flexible.\" He also said, \"We\u2019re in the fun part right now.\"  In December 2015, the DSO announced an extension of Slatkin's contract as music director through the 2017-2018 season, after which time he is scheduled to relinquish the music directorship of the orchestra and to become its first-ever music director laureate, holding the latter post at least through the 2019-2020 season. In the music director laureate role, he will program and conduct four weeks a season and advise on artistic and personnel matters. Slatkin is credited with having rebuilt the DSO after a six-month strike and elevating it as a pillar of civic pride through innovative live webcasts and engaging community programming.Slatkin's compositions include The Raven (1971) for narrator and orchestra after Edgar Allan Poe, and Kinah (2015), an elegy dedicated to the memory of his parents, which received its world premiere with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in December 2015.  He published his debut book, Conducting Business: Unveiling the Mystery Behind the Maestro, in 2012. In addition to his earlier Saint Louis recordings for RCA and EMI, Slatkin has conducted several recordings for the Naxos label, including the first commercial recording of William Bolcom's Songs of Innocence and of Experience, which received Grammy awards for Best Classical Album and Best Choral Performance.On November 1, 2009, Slatkin suffered a heart attack while conducting in the Netherlands.  In May 2010, the Orchestre National de Lyon announced the appointment of Slatkin as its music director, effective with the 2011-2012 season.

{"name": "Michael A Holmes", "department": "Philosophy", "course_descr": "Required discussion section for PHIL UN3960 Epistemology.\n", "wiki_title": "Michael Smerconish", "wiki_page": "Michael A. Smerconish (born March 15, 1962) is an American radio host and television presenter, newspaper columnist, author, and lawyer. He broadcasts The Michael Smerconish Program weekdays at 9:00 a.m. ET on SiriusXM's POTUS Channel (124), and hosts the CNN and CNN International program Smerconish at 9:00 a.m. ET on Saturdays. He is a Sunday newspaper columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer. Smerconish has authored seven books: six non-fiction works and one novel. He is also of counsel to the Philadelphia law firm of Kline & Specter.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSmerconish was born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, the son of Florence (Grovich) and Walter Smerconish. He is of Italian, Serbian descent. He graduated from Central Bucks High School West, a public high school in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He received his B.A. from Lehigh University and his Juris Doctor degree from the  University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDespite being raised in a Republican household, and while in his early teens, Smerconish began to correspond with the then Democratic Mayor of Philadelphia, Frank L. Rizzo. Eventually the two would meet and establish a close relationship. But Smerconish\u2019s start in politics came in the spring of 1980 when his father competed unsuccessfully in a Republican primary for the Pennsylvania state legislature. Smerconish worked tirelessly in his father\u2019s campaign during his own senior year in high school, during which he registered to vote for the first time. Despite his father\u2019s election loss, Smerconish was smitten with GOP politics, having met both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush during the build-up to the Pennsylvania Primary.\nIn 1980, Smerconish founded Lehigh University Youth for Reagan/Bush. While a full-time student at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, he ran for the Pennsylvania state legislature, losing the Republican Primary by 419 votes. After losing his primary, Smerconish continued at Penn Law, while working nearly full-time running political campaigns. In 1986, he was responsible for the City of Philadelphia in Senator Arlen Specter\u2019s re-election win, and in 1987, Smerconish served as Rizzo\u2019s Political Director in Rizzo\u2019s losing (Republican) bid to re-take City Hall.  After graduating from Penn Law, he opened up a title insurance agency with his brother Wally, before being appointed, at age 29, by the administration of President George H.W. Bush to serve as the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Regional Administrator for Philadelphia Region III (consisting of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia) under Secretary Jack Kemp.\nAfter supporting only Republican presidential candidates for three decades, Smerconish publicly broke with the GOP and endorsed Barack Obama for president on October 19, 2008. In a 2,000-word essay for Salon titled \"Why this lifelong Republican may vote for Obama,\" citing the Republican Party's failure to capture Osama bin Laden after seven years of war, he wrote, \"All of this drives me bat-shit, and it just might drive me into the Obama camp. That\u2019d be quite a departure.\"He has urged the Republican Party to pursue \"moderation on social issues in order to advance a suburban agenda for the GOP.\" Writing a 2010 op-ed for The Washington Post titled \"On cable TV and talk radio, a push toward polarization,\" Smerconish said, \"Buying gas or groceries or attending back-to-school nights, I speak to people for whom the issues are a mixed bag; they are liberal on some, conservative on others, middle of the road on the rest. But politicians don't take their cues from those people. No, politicians emulate the world of punditry.\"On February 21, 2010, he announced in a newspaper column that he had left the Republican Party. Discussing Smerconish's move to the middle, Manuel Roig-Franzia of The Washington Post wrote, \"It may be conventional wisdom that the only way to truly succeed in the world of talk is to occupy one of the poles. But Smerconish is betting his career that there\u2019s a great untapped center.\"\n\n\n== Legal ==\nSmerconish\u2019s tenure at HUD came to a close after George H.W. Bush was defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election. In 1993, Smerconish began what would become a decade practicing law with legendary trial attorney James E. Beasley, who would become the benefactor and namesake of the Temple University Beasley School of Law. Smerconish became acquainted with Beasley while at HUD when he sought the latter\u2019s legal opinion for a possible defamation action against Steve Lopez, then a columnist with The Philadelphia Inquirer. Beasley was noted for his record-breaking defamation wins against the newspaper. (No lawsuit was filed by Smerconish against Lopez.) Working closely with Beasley for a decade, Smerconish specialized in complex tort litigation. At a 2015 legal seminar sponsored by the Pennsylvania Bar Institute, Smerconish wrote an essay summarizing some of his lessons learned working for Beasley.\nSmerconish's legal work spanned various subject areas, including contracts, medical malpractice, and products liability. His clients included: the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (in an action against a music group responsible for publishing an FOP photograph on an album cover that advocated the murder of police); the City of Rome, Italy (in a contract dispute against the Barnes Foundation); and Orlin Norris, a professional boxer who through Smerconish sued promoter Don King for a shot at the heavyweight title. In a medical malpractice action years before his House of Horrors came to light, Smerconish successfully sued abortionist Kermit Gosnell. While in active practice, Smerconish served one term as a member of the Board of Directors of The Philadelphia Trial Lawyer\u2019s Association. Today, Smerconish\u2019s law license hangs in the office of two of the most successful trial attorneys in America: Tom Kline and Shanin Specter of the Philadelphia law firm Kline & Specter.\n\n\n== Media ==\nHis media work grew out of his unique political experiences at an early age (working for Vice President Bush, running unsuccessfully for the state legislature, running campaigns for Arlen Specter and Frank Rizzo and ultimately being appointed to a sub-cabinet-level position by President George H.W. Bush).  In the spring of 1990, Smerconish made his first radio appearance as a guest of a guest-host, Brian Tierney, who was then a substitute host on Philadelphia talk station 96.5 FM WWDB. During the 1991 Philadelphia mayoral election, Smerconish worked at WWDB as a political analyst. He then transitioned from a guest to a guest-host. By 1993, he had his own program Sunday nights from 8 p.m. until midnight, during which time his day job was the practice of law. In 1996, after the death of longtime broadcaster Dominic Quinn, Smerconish moved to Saturday and Sunday mornings, the latter of which allowed him to be the lead-in of Sid Mark\u2019s Sunday with Sinatra. WWDB was then sold by broadcast entrepreneurs Chuck and Susan Schwartz and a new owner began selling informercials masked as programming which Smerconish refused to honor. That led to his 1997 move to CBS affiliate WPHT (formerly known as WCAU AM). By the following year, he was moved to afternoon drive, all the while maintaining his practice of law. Only when in September of 2003, after the firing of Don Imus, whose morning drive slot he took, did Smerconish become a talk show host who was a lawyer instead of a lawyer who was a talk show host.He has received many accolades for his work as a broadcaster including Talkers Magazine consistently naming him one of America's most important talk show hosts,  and Radio & Records naming him the nation's 2006 Local Personality of the Year.  In 2003, he was named to \"The Pennsylvania Report Power 75 List\" of influential figures in Pennsylvania politics.  The National Association of Broadcasters selected him as a 2011 Marconi Award finalist in the category of Best Network/Syndicated Host. He has often been the recipient of several Philadelphia Achievement in Radio awards, including Best Talk Show Host and Best Evening Program. Philadelphia Magazine named him the City\u2019s best talk show host in 2004, as well as one of the City\u2019s most powerful citizens.\nIn February 2009, Smerconish\u2019s program was placed into national syndication by Dial Global. On August 20, 2009, Smerconish became the first talk radio host to interview President Barack Obama live from the White House, one of seven radio conversations he's had with Obama. The interview was held in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt conducted fireside chats. The President took questions from Smerconish and his listeners on a variety of subjects including the recent debates on the then-pending Affordable Care Act. He has also interviewed Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as Vice Presidents Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Joe Biden. He has often said that he has spoken with everyone who interested him with the exception of the elusive creator of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David.\nAs a result of his increasing radio prominence, Smerconish was increasingly invited to appear on television, first locally and then nationally. In Philadelphia, he was first asked to appear by his friend and eventual mentor, Larry Kane, on WCAU Channel 10 providing election night analysis. He then became a regular on the local ABC affiliate (WPVI) program Inside Story, hosted by Marc Howard. And he often appeared as the guest of Lynn Doyle, host of Comcast\u2019s It\u2019s Your Call on CN8. CNN soon tapped Smerconish as a guest (and guest host) of Arthel Neville on the program TalkBack Live. CNN engaged Smerconish as a legal analyst and also utilized him as the substitute for Glenn Beck on CNN\u2019s Headline News. CNN briefly aired a program called Attorneys at Law featuring Smerconish, Jeffrey Toobin, and Lisa Bloom. When CNN switched to wall-to-wall coverage of the Iraq Invasion, the program was interrupted and never returned. Smerconish then moved to MSNBC as a contributor at the invitation of Phil Griffin, the future head of MSNBC, where he began guest hosting Scarborough Country in the absence of former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough. When in 2007, MSNBC fired Don Imus for a racial slur, it was Smerconish who was invited by the network to guest host Imus\u2019 time slot during the week of April 23\u201327 as a replacement on a trial basis. In-studio guests included Jon Anderson of Yes and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. MSNBC eventually hired Scarborough for the slot formerly held by Imus and re-branded the program as Morning Joe (where Smerconish has never been a guest). At MSNBC, Smerconish\u2019s role then became one of appearing daily with Tamron Hall, host of News Nation, and as a guest host of Hardball in the absence of Chris Matthews, a position he filled for five years. At the same time\u2014despite the polarized media climate and differences between MSNBC and Fox News\u2014he guest hosted The Radio Factor for Bill O'Reilly.\nIn 2013, Smerconish decided to give up his terrestrial radio platform then consisting of 80 radio stations across the country to move to the POTUS Channel 124 on Sirius XM Radio. He said at the time that this reflected his desire to be \"non-partisan\" in discussing issues; having left the Republican party in 2010, adding that satellite radio would give him more freedom to talk politics without a party label.Then, in early 2014, Smerconish left MSNBC after Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, invited him to host his own program there. Said Smerconish at the time, \"The type of program I do on radio is far more in keeping with what CNN does on TV than it is with FOX or MSNBC.\" Smerconish broadcasts on CNN Saturdays at 9:00 am ET. The show also broadcast around the world by CNN International.\nSmerconish has appeared on virtually every television program where politics is a staple, from Larry King Live to The View, from Real Time with Bill Maher to The Today Show, from The Colbert Report to The O'Reilly Factor.He also writes a Sunday column in The Philadelphia Inquirer, and his work has been re-printed in newspapers nationwide, including The Washington Post, The Dallas Morning News, The Denver Post, Miami Herald, Boston Herald, Sacramento Bee, and Detroit News.\nOn June 5, 2020, rapper Meek Mill released his song \"Otherside of America\". Rolling Stone writes that Mill \"paints a vivid picture of life on 'the other side of America.'\" In the song's final seconds, Mill includes audio from a December 2018 interview with Smerconish during which the two discussed the need for criminal justice reform. \n\n\n== Books ==\nSmerconish\u2019s work as a radio broadcaster was consumed with the events of 9/11 for years following 2001. While paying close attention to the hearings of the 9/11 Commission, Smerconish picked up on a question put to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by Commissioner John Lehman which suggested that political correctness played a role in airport security before and after 9/11. Smerconish subsequently interviewed Lehman whereupon Lehman shared the fact that testimony in front of the Commission suggested there was a limit on the number of Arab males who could be pulled out of line at any one time for secondary screening. Smerconish wrote about Lehman\u2019s account for his (then) column in the Philadelphia Daily News and stayed on the subject, eventually testifying before a Senate subcommittee at the invitation of Senator Arlen Specter. Ultimately, Smerconish wrote his first book, Flying Blind: How Political Correctness Continues to Compromise Airline Safety Post 9/11 (2004), about his investigation, and donated all proceeds to the Garden of Reflection, a 9/11 tribute garden in his native Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\nHis second book, a New York Times best-seller, was Muzzled: From T-Ball to Terrorism \u2013 True Stories That Should Be Fiction (2007), which sought to link the restraint of fighting the war on terror to domestic political correctness.His third book, another New York Times best-seller, Murdered by Mumia: A Life Sentence of Loss, Pain, and Injustice (2007) (co-written by Maureen Faulkner) told the story of slain Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner, in what was arguably the highest profile death penalty case in the world. Despite being convicted and sentenced to death by a Philadelphia jury for the murder of Faulkner, Mumia Abu-Jamal became a cause celebre for death penalty opponents around the world. In print, Smerconish told Faulkner\u2019s story, and donated the $200,000 he was paid to write the book to a charitable fund established in the slain officer\u2019s name.\nHis fourth book, Morning Drive: Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started Talking (2009) detailed his evolving political positions against the backdrop of his talk radio career. Morning Drive\u2019s chapters were evenly split between issue-oriented essays and back-of-the-house media tales.\nHe then returned to the subject of 9/11 for his fifth book, Instinct: The Man Who Stopped the 20th Hijacker (2009), which tells the true story of Jose Melendez-Perez, a Customs and Border Protection Inspector at Orlando International Airport, who thwarted the entry of Mohammed al Qahtani, the 20th hijacker, one month before 9/11.  Once again, Smerconish gave all author profits to charity, this time, the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Smerconish subsequently sought to credit Melendez-Perez with playing a role in the killing of Osama bin Laden because he denied al Qahtani's entry and Qahtani, as a prisoner of war in Guantanamo Bay, was one of the detainees who identified bin Laden's courier, leading to the successful raid of SEAL Team Six.\nTalk: A Novel (2014) is Smerconish's sixth book and first fictional work, about the life of conservative talk show host Stan Powers. Powers, a former slacker and stoner with no political knowledge, is nevertheless able to quickly ascend the talk radio world by his entertainment skills and recitation of red-meat talking points (which conflict with his own opinions). The more Stan Powers says on fictionalized radio station WRGT with which he personally disagrees, the higher he sees his star rising. With a Republican convention coming to his hometown of Tampa, Florida, will Powers continue to spout the lines that pay for his beach front condominium, or will he take the professional risk of being true to himself? Warner Horizon Television has optioned the rights to the novel.\n\nClowns to the Left of Me, Jokers to the Right (2018) is Smerconish's seventh book, a compilation of 100 of Smerconish\u2019s more memorable newspaper columns in The Philadelphia Inquirer  and Philadelphia Daily News, each with a new Afterword, drawn from the 1,047 he published between 2001 and 2016.  As characterized by Foreward Reviews: \"Michael Smerconish\u2019s collection is compelling and entertaining\u2014not as a filtering of daily news through a predictable ideological lens, but as a group of insightful entries into conversations about current events and issues\u2026.This sampling of Smerconish\u2019s columns exemplifies the kind of discourse, based on reason and evidence, that makes a newspaper, in print or online, indispensable to citizens of democracy.\" As characterized by The Daily Beast, \"[The columns] make for enjoyable reading and remind us that journalism properly practiced requires a good deal of nerve, honesty, and insight, along with openness to dialogue and the determination not to live in a bubble.\" All author proceeds are being donated to the Children's Crisis Treatment Center, which provides social services to children in Philadelphia who are the victims of trauma.\nAfter the release of Clowns, Smerconish composed a one-man show in which he draws on columns reprinted in the book and weaves them together with his explanation of the political divide.  He has since toured the country in support of what he calls \u201cAmerican Life in Columns\u201d, appearing at the Paley Center in Los Angeles, Hobby Center in Houston, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Park Square Theatre in St. Paul, Sellersville Theatre outside of Philadelphia, the Crofoot Ballroom in Pontiac, Michigan, and at City Wineries located in Boston, Chicago, New York City, Atlanta and Nashville.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSmerconish's Home Page\nCNN page for Smerconish\nMichael's Twitter page\nMichael's Facebook page\nSmerconish's \"The Pulse\" feed for The Philadelphia Inquirer\nSmerconish's Soundcloud featuring cuts from The Michael Smerconish Program\nSmerconish's Kline & Specter bio\nMichael Smerconish on IMDb\nAppearances on C-SPAN", "label": 0}

She grew up in Brooklyn and received her B.A. from Wesleyan University and Ph.D. from Yale University.\nHartman was one of the 26 individuals chosen to be a MacArthur Fellow in 2019.\n\n\n== Fields of interest ==\nHartman's major fields of interest are African-American and American literature and cultural history, slavery, law and literature, gender studies, and performance studies. She is on the editorial board of the journal Callaloo. Hartman has been a Fulbright, Rockefeller, Whitney Oates, and University of California President's Fellow and was awarded the 2007 Narrative Prize from Narrative Magazine and the Gustav Myers Award for Human Rights. She is the author of the influential Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-making in Nineteenth Century America (Oxford University Press, 1997), Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007), and Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval (W. W. Norton, 2019). Hartman's \"essays have been widely published and anthologized.\"\n\n\n== Theoretical concepts ==\nHartman introduces the idea of \"critical fabulation\" in her article \"Venus in Two Acts\", although she could be said to be engaged in the practice in both of her full-length books, Scenes of Subjection and Lose Your Mother. The term \"critical fabulation\" signifies a writing methodology that combines historical and archival research with critical theory and fictional narrative. Critical fabulation is a tool that Hartman uses in her scholarly practice to make productive sense of the gaps and silences in the archive of trans-Atlantic slavery that absent the voices of enslaved women.\nHartman also theorizes the \"afterlife of slavery\" in Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route. The \"afterlife of slavery\" can be characterized by the enduring presence of slavery's racialized violence still present in contemporary society.  Hartman outlines slavery's imprint on all sectors of society as evidenced in historical archives that may or may not exist.  Hence, the archive lives on through the social structure of the society and its citizens.  Hartman describes this process in detail in Lose Your Mother: \"I wanted to engage the past, knowing that its perils and dangers still threatened and that even now lives hung in the balance. Slavery had established a measure of man and a ranking of life and worth that has yet to be undone. If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America, it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the burden of a too-long memory, but because black lives are still imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago. This is the afterlife of slavery\u2014skewed life chances, limited access to health and education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment. I, too, am the afterlife of slavery.\" Hartman went back to Africa to learn more about slavery and came back having learned more about herself.\nHartman further fleshes out the afterlives of slavery through the ways in which photographic capture and enclosure spills into domestic spaces. Hartman exposes the limits of such capture as she describes the hallway as a regulative, yet intimate space. She writes, \u201cIt is inside but public\u2026The hallway is a space uneasy with expectation and tense with force of unmet desire. It is the liminal zone between the inside and outside for the one who stays in the ghetto; the reformer documenting the habitat of the poor passes through without noticing it, failing to see what can be created in cramped space, if not an overture, a desecration, or to regard our beautiful flaws and terrible ornaments.\"\n\n\n== Contributions to the understanding of slavery ==\nHartman has made literary and theoretical contributions to the understanding of slavery. Her first book, Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America, is an examination of, among other topics, the intersection of slavery, gender, and the development of progressivism in the United States through the exploration of blank genealogies, memory, and the lingering effects of racism. Working through a variety of cultural materials \u2013- diaries, journals, legal texts, slave and other narratives, and historical song and dance\u2014Hartman explores the precarious institution of slave power. Her second book, Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (2007), confronts the troubled relationships among memory, narratives, and representation. She concentrates on the \"non-history\" of the slave, the manner in which slavery \"erased any conventional modality for writing an intelligible past\". By weaving her own biography into a historical construction, \"she [also] explores and evokes the non-spaces of black experience\u2014the experience through which the African captive became a slave, became a non-person, became alienated from personhood. Through these experiences, came the title: \"Because of the slave trade you lose your mother, if you know your history, you know where you come from. To lose your mother was to be denied your kin, country and identity. To lose your mother was to forget your past\" (85).Hartman's contributions to understanding slavery caught the attention of UC Irvine's Frank B. Wilderson III, well known for setting groundwork and coining the phrase \"Afro-pessimism\". This criticism examines unflinching paradigmatic analysis on the structures of modernity produced by slavery and genocide. While he considers her Scenes of Subjection as Afro-pessimist scholarship, Hartman herself has not called it so.\n\n\n== Contributions to historical archiving ==\nHartman has contributed insight into the forms and functions of the historical archive, providing both pointed critiques of and methodological guides to approaching the archive in scholarly work.  In both Scenes of Subjection and Lose Your Mother, Hartman accesses and critically interrogates the historical archive. In the case of the latter, much of this is done through the combined re-reading of historical narratives of slavery and through the connection of these narratives to the physical location of Ghana. Hartman, who centers much of her interrogation of slavery's archive on Elmina Castle, inserts her own voice as one way to counter the silences surrounding forgotten slaves.The difficulty of this excavation process is revealed partly in the continued tension between Hartman's interest in slavery and the rejection of this interest on the part of Ghanaians, who are depicted as ostracizing Hartman in a number of instances in the text. In addition, and though she draws from \"plantation journals and documents, newspaper accounts, missionary tracts, travel writing ... government reports, et cetera,\" Hartman recognizes that \"these documents are 'not free from barbarism.'\" Arguably all of Hartman's work is guided by \"the impossibility of fully recovering the experience of the enslaved and the emancipated\" from these written accounts, and she reads them \"against the grain\", knowing that in her use of these \"official\" records, she runs \"the risk of reinforcing the authority of these documents even as I try to use them for contrary purposes\".Hartman introduces the concept of narrative restraint in her article \"Venus in Two Acts\" to delay an archival impulse to continually register as \"a death sentence, a tomb, a display of the violated body\". In this article, she returns to the slaver Recovery for an exploration that began in Lose Your Mother. Unable to write about the girl named Venus owing to her brief appearance in the archive, Hartman's attempts to resuscitate possible narratives for her ultimately lead to failure. She explains, \"But in the end I was forced to admit that I wanted to console myself and to escape the slave hold with a vision of something other than the bodies of two girls settling on the floor of the Atlantic.\" Hartman ultimately restrains her desire to imaginatively recreate Venus's final days, her passages in Lose Your Mother only briefly mentioning Venus's fate. Her inclusion in \"Venus\" of the narratives omitted in Lose Your Mother, with the caveat that such narratives push beyond the boundaries of the archive, leads to the concept of narrative restraint, \"the refusal to fill in the gaps and provide closure.\" While she excavates the historical archive in her attempt to understand the possibilities for subjectivity for the black slave (in Scenes of Subjection), the possibilities for African Diasporic community (in Lose Your Mother), a question she in her article \"Venus in Two Acts\" serves as a guiding principle and a lesson on archival method: \"If it is no longer sufficient to expose the scandal, then how might it be possible to generate a different set of descriptions from this archive?\"\n\n\n== The Promised Lands ==\nBlack people in the Diaspora, with no knowledge of a past, try to imagine a past that is nothing like the harsh present entangled with murder, humiliation, and incarceration. Such imaginations include the pre-colonial era of Kings and Queens. Rastafarians envision a sort of replica of such a past into the future with calls of the downfall of Babylon and a return to the Promised Land. Hartman explains: \"The heirs of slaves wanted a past of which they could be proud, so they conveniently forgot the distinctions between the rulers and the ruled and closed eyes to slavery in Africa. They pretended that their ancestors had once worn the king\u2019s vestments and assumed grand civilization of Asante as their own.\" This, coupled with a longing for belonging only achievable by escaping the brutality of the West's racism and returning to Africa the homeland, led to disbelief and shock when encountering Ghanaians who favored migrating to the U.S. to escape the impoverishment of the present. Hartman notes: \"African Americans entertained fantasies of return and Ghanaians of departure. From where we each were standing, we did not see the same past, nor did we share a common vision of the Promised Land.\" To the Ghanaians, the Promised Land is America, the images heavily circulated in movies, music videos, and more, that tell one story of wealth and prosperity even for Black Americans.\n\n\n== Works ==\nWayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval (W. W. Norton & Company, 2019)\nLose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007)\nScenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth Century America (Oxford University Press, 1997)\n\n\n== Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments ==\nHartman's most recent work, Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval (2019), explores the lives of various Black women in Harlem and Philadelphia during the 1890s. Hartman describes the boundaries of Black life and womanhood through both interracial and intra-racial relationships and examines how Black women's sexuality was policed and constructed within an ideology of criminality at the turn of the twentieth century. These \"deviant\" behaviors are referred to as \"wayward\" and illustrate how Black women navigate society under surveillance, violence, and partial or conditional citizenship. The social life of Black women under surveillance results in these wayward movements being characterized as \"illegal\". These movements serve as an act of resistance against not only the state, but the examination of Black life under the guise of policy researchers, sociologists, and reformers aiming to improve Black women in New York and Philadelphia. Hartman asks how to imagine Black womanhood outside of the archive and \"the sociological imagination that could only ever recognize her as a problem,\" invoking DuBois' famed question in The Souls of Black Folk: \"How does it feel to be a problem?\" Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval critiques the pathologization of Black women's lives by constructing a social space of freedom and \"waywardness\" as acts of world-making and possibility.It won the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award (Criticism).\n\n\n== Statements ==\n\"I think of my work as bridging theory and narrative.

Andrews, a child actress and singer, appeared in the West End in 1948 and made her Broadway debut in The Boy Friend (1954), and in 1952 she voiced Princess Zeila in the Italian animated film The Singing Princess.  Billed as \"Britain's youngest prima donna\", she rose to prominence starring in Broadway musicals such as My Fair Lady (1956)  playing Eliza Doolittle and Camelot (1960) playing Queen Guinevere. In 1957, Andrews starred in the premiere of Rodgers and Hammerstein's written-for-television musical Cinderella, a live, network broadcast seen by over 100 million viewers. Andrews made her feature film debut in Mary Poppins (1964) and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the title role. She starred in The Sound of Music (1965), playing Maria von Trapp and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. \nBetween 1964 and 1986, she starred in The Americanization of Emily (1964), Hawaii (1966), Torn Curtain (1966), Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967), Star! (1968), The Tamarind Seed (1974), 10 (1979), S.O.B. (1981), Victor/Victoria (1982), That's Life! (1986) and Duet for One (1986). After 1986, her workload decreased, appearing in two films in 1991 and not again until 2000.  Since the turn of the new millennium, however, her career has had a revival, with central roles in the Shrek series as Queen Lillian, in The Princess Diaries and its sequel as Queen Clarisse Renaldi and in the Despicable Me series as Gru's mother Marlena. She has also worked hosting performance shows such as Great Performances and narrating documentaries such as the 2004 Emmy-winning series Broadway: The American Musical.\nIn 2000, Andrews was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the performing arts. In 2002, she was ranked #59 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. In 2003, she revisited her first Broadway success, this time as a stage director, with a revival of The Boy Friend. From 2001 to 2004, Andrews starred in The Princess Diaries (2001) and The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004). From 2004 to 2018, she lent her voice to the Shrek animated films, Despicable Me (2010) and Aquaman (2018).\nAndrews has won an Academy Award, a BAFTA, five Golden Globes, three Grammys, two Emmys, the AFI Life Achievement Award, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, the Kennedy Center Honors Award, and the Disney Legends Award. Apart from her musical career, she is also an author of children's books and has published two autobiographies, Home: A Memoir of My Early Years (2008) and Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years (2019).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJulia Elizabeth Wells was born on 1 October 1935 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England. Her mother, Barbara Ward Wells (n\u00e9e Morris; 1910\u20131984) was born in Chertsey and married Edward Charles \"Ted\" Wells (1908\u20131990), a teacher of metalwork and woodwork, in 1932. Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend. Andrews discovered her true parentage from her mother in 1950, although it was not publicly disclosed until her 2008 autobiography.With the outbreak of World War II, Barbara and Ted Wells went their separate ways and were soon divorced. Each remarried: Barbara to Ted Andrews, in 1943, and Ted Wells in 1944 to Winifred Maud (Hyde) Birkhead, a war widow and former hairstylist working a lathe at a war work factory that employed them both in Hinchley Wood, Surrey. Ted Wells assisted with evacuating children to Surrey during the Blitz, while Barbara joined Ted Andrews in entertaining the troops through the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA).\nAndrews lived briefly with Ted Wells and her brother John in Surrey. In 1940, Ted Wells sent young Julia to live with her mother and stepfather, who the elder Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to Julie Andrews' 2008 autobiography Home, while Julie had been used to calling Ted Andrews \"Uncle Ted\", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as \"Pop\", while her father remained \"Dad\" or \"Daddy\" to her. Julie disliked this change.\nThe Andrews family was \"very poor\" and they \"lived in a bad slum area of London,\" Andrews recalled, adding, \"That was a very black period in my life.\" According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic. Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door. As the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford better surroundings, first to Beckenham and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of Hersham. The Andrews family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews' maternal grandmother had served as a maid.Andrews' stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the independent arts educational school Cone-Ripman School (now known commonly as ArtsEd) in London, and thereafter with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. \"She had an enormous influence on me,\" Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, \"She was my third mother \u2013 I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world.\" In her memoir Julie Andrews \u2013 My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records, \"The range, accuracy and tone of Julie's voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch\", though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home. According to Andrews, \"Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was\". Of her own voice, she says, \"I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range \u2013 dogs would come from miles around.\" After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career in Britain ===\nBeginning in 1945, and for the next two years, Julie Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. \"Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening,\" Andrews explained. She would stand on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. \"It must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right.\"Petula Clark recalls touring round Britain by train to sing for the troops with Andrews, who was three years younger; they slept in the luggage racks. Clark said \"It was fun\u2014and not a lot of kids were having fun\".Julie Andrews gained her big break when her stepfather introduced her to Val Parnell, whose Moss Empires controlled prominent venues in London. Andrews made her professional solo debut at the London Hippodrome singing the difficult aria \"Je suis Titania\" from Mignon as part of a musical revue called \"Starlight Roof\" on 22 October 1947. She played the Hippodrome for one year. Of \"Starlight Roof,\" Andrews recalled: \"There was this wonderful American person and comedian, Wally Boag, who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy.\"On 1 November 1948, Julie Andrews (aged 13) became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a Royal Command Variety Performance before King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at the London Palladium, where she performed along with Danny Kaye, the Nicholas Brothers, and the comedy team George and Bert Bernard.Julie Andrews followed her parents into radio and television. She performed in musical interludes of the BBC Light Programme comedy show Up the Pole and later Educating Archie, of which she was a cast member from 1950 to 1952. She reportedly made her television d\u00e9but on the BBC programme RadiOlympia Showtime on 8 October 1949.Andrews appeared on West End theatre at the London Casino, where she played one year each as Princess Badroulbadour in Aladdin and the egg in Humpty Dumpty. She also appeared on provincial stages in Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood, as well as starring as the lead role in Cinderella.In 1952, she voiced Princess Zeila in the English dub of the Italian animated movie The Singing Princess (La Rosa di Bagdad, 1949), in her first film and first venture into voice-over work.\n\n\n=== Early career in the United States ===\n\nOn 30 September 1954, on the eve of her 19th birthday, Julie Andrews made her Broadway debut portraying Polly Browne in the already highly successful London musical The Boy Friend. To the critics, Andrews was the stand-out performer in the show. Near the end of her Boy Friend contract, as a Londoner Andrews was asked to audition for the role of Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady on Broadway and got the part. In November 1955, Andrews was signed to appear with Bing Crosby in what one source calls the first made-for-television film, High Tor, which aired on the Ford Star Jubilee in March 1956.Andrews auditioned for a part in the Richard Rodgers musical Pipe Dream. Although Rodgers wanted her for Pipe Dream, he advised her to take the part in the Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner musical My Fair Lady if it were offered to her. In 1956, she appeared on stage in My Fair Lady as Eliza Doolittle to Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins. Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews' talent that concurrent with her run in My Fair Lady she was featured in the Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical, Cinderella.\n\nCinderella was broadcast live on CBS on 31 March 1957 under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini and had an estimated 107 million viewers. The show was broadcast in colour from CBS Studio 72, at 2248 Broadway in New York City. Only a black-and-white kinescope remains, which has been released on DVD. Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance.In 1957, Andrews released her debut solo album, The Lass with the Delicate Air, which harked back to her British music hall days. The album includes performances of English folk songs as well as the World War II anthem, \"London Pride\", a patriotic song written by No\u00ebl Coward in 1941 during the Blitz, which Andrews herself had survived.Between 1956 and 1962, Andrews guest-starred on The Ed Sullivan Show (15 July 1956), and also appeared on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, What's My Line?, The Jack Benny Program, The Bell Telephone Hour and The Garry Moore Show. In June 1962, Andrews co-starred in Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall, a CBS special with Carol Burnett.\nIn 1960, Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as Queen Guinevere in Camelot, along with Richard Burton (as King Arthur) and newcomer Robert Goulet. However, because film studio head Jack L. Warner decided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition for her casting in the film version of My Fair Lady, Eliza was instead played by the established film actress Audrey Hepburn. As Warner later recalled, the decision was easy, \"In my business, I have to know who brings people and their money to a cinema box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop.\"\n\n\n=== Film stardom ===\n\nIn 1963, Andrews began her work in the title role of Disney's musical film Mary Poppins. Walt Disney had seen her performance as Queen Guinevere and thought she would be perfect for the role of the British nanny who is \"practically perfect in every way!\" Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth, but Disney firmly insisted, saying, \"We'll wait for you.\"Mary Poppins became the biggest box-office draw in Disney history. Andrews won the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance. She and her co-stars also won the 1965 Grammy Award for Best Album for Children. As a measure of \"sweet revenge,\" as Poppins songwriter Richard M. Sherman put it, Andrews closed her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes by saying, \"And, finally, my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie and who made all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner.\" My Fair Lady was in direct competition for the awards.\n\nAndrews starred opposite James Garner in The Americanization of Emily (1964), for which she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. A comedy-drama war film set in London during World War II, Andrews has described it as her favourite film, a sentiment shared by her co-star Garner.Andrews starred in The Sound of Music (1965), which was the highest-grossing film of its year. In 2018, it remains the third highest-grossing film of all time in the US, adjusted for inflation. For her performance as Maria von Trapp, Andrews won her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She was nominated a second time for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, though in both awards she lost to Julie Christie, for Darling.\nAfter completing The Sound of Music, Andrews appeared as a guest star on the NBC-TV variety series The Andy Williams Show. She followed this television appearance with an Emmy Award-winning special, The Julie Andrews Show, which featured Gene Kelly and the New Christy Minstrels as guests. It aired on NBC-TV in November 1965. In 1966, Andrews starred in Hawaii, the second highest-grossing film of its year. Also in 1966, she starred opposite Paul Newman in Torn Curtain, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The following year, she played the title character in Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. At the time, Thoroughly Modern Millie and Torn Curtain were the biggest and second biggest hits in Universal Pictures history, respectively.\n\n\n=== Mid-career ===\n\nAndrews next appeared in two of Hollywood's most expensive flops: Star! (1968), a biopic of Gertrude Lawrence; and Darling Lili (1970), co-starring Rock Hudson and directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards. Andrews was the first choice to play the English witch Eglantine Price in Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971); Angela Lansbury was cast.Andrews continued working in television. In 1969, she shared the spotlight with singer Harry Belafonte for an NBC-TV special, An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte. In 1971, she appeared as a guest for the Grand Opening Special of Walt Disney World, and that same year she and Carol Burnett headlined a CBS special, Julie and Carol At Lincoln Center. In 1972\u201373, Andrews starred in her own television variety series, The Julie Andrews Hour, on the ABC network. The show won seven Emmy Awards but was cancelled after one season.\nBetween 1973 and 1975, Andrews continued her association with ABC by headlining five variety specials for the network. She guest-starred on The Muppet Show in 1977, and the following year, she appeared again with the Muppets on a CBS television variety special. The programme, Julie Andrews: One Step Into Spring, aired in March 1978, to mixed reviews and mediocre ratings. She made only two other films in the 1970s, The Tamarind Seed (1974) and 10 (1979), both successful at the box office and by critics reviews.\nIn February 1980, Andrews headlined \"Because We Care\", a CBS-TV special with 30 major stars raising funds for Cambodian Famine victims through Operation California (now Operation USA, on whose Board she serves). Later that year, she starred in Little Miss Marker as English rose Amanda Worthington (a label she had first been given in the 1960s). In Blake Edwards' S.O.B. (1981), she played Sally Miles, a character who agrees to \"show my boobies\" in a scene in the film-within-a-film. \nA dual role of Victoria Grant and Count Victor Grezhinski in the film Victor/Victoria (1982), meant she performed with James Garner once again. Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, as well as a nomination for the 1982 Academy Award for Best Actress, her third Oscar nomination. In 1983, Andrews was chosen as the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year by the Harvard University Theatrical Society. That year, she co-starred with Burt Reynolds in The Man Who Loved Women. Her next two films were That's Life! and Duet for One (both 1986), which earned her Golden Globe nominations.\n\nIn December 1987, Andrews starred in an ABC Christmas special, Julie Andrews: The Sound Of Christmas, which went on to win five Emmy Awards. Two years later, she was reunited for the third time with Carol Burnett for a variety special which aired on ABC in December 1989.\nIn 1991, Andrews made her television dramatic debut in the ABC made-for-TV film, Our Sons, co-starring Ann-Margret. Andrews was named a Disney Legend within the year. In the summer of 1992, Andrews starred in her first television sitcom, the short-lived Julie aired on ABC for only seven episodes and co-starred James Farentino. In December 1992, she hosted the NBC holiday special, Christmas In Washington.\nHaving played a Cockney flower seller in My Fair Lady, Andrews had an orangey-salmon pink rose named after her at London\u2019s Chelsea Flower Show in 1992. Stating she was \"ever so flattered\", portions of the sales of the \"Julie Andrews Rose\" were donated to charity.In 1993, she starred in a limited run at the Manhattan Theatre Club in the American premiere of Stephen Sondheim's revue, Putting It Together. Between 1994 and 1995, Andrews recorded two solo albums \u2013 the first saluted the music of Richard Rodgers and the second paid tribute to the words of Alan Jay Lerner. In 1995, she starred in the stage musical version of Victor/Victoria. It was her first appearance in a Broadway show in 35 years. Opening on Broadway on 25 October 1995 at the Marquis Theatre, it later went on the road for a world tour. When she was the only Tony Award nominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because she felt the entire production was snubbed.\n\n\n=== Loss of singing voice ===\nAndrews was forced to quit the show towards the end of the Broadway run in 1997 when she developed hoarseness in her voice. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, reportedly to remove non-cancerous nodules from her throat, though she later stated the hoarseness was due to \"a certain kind of muscular striation [that] happens on the vocal cords\"\u2014itself the result of a strain from Victor/Victoria (she added \"I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.\") She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and gave a rasp to her speaking voice. In 1999, she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews' stepdaughter Jennifer Edwards said in 1999 \"it's been two years, and it [her singing voice] still hasn't returned.\" The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount.\nAndrews admits that she has never recovered from the botched attempt to remove nodules from her vocal cords back in 1997. Her famous, four-octave soprano was then reduced to a fragile alto \u2013 she was quoted at the time as saying \"I can sing the hell out of \"Old Man River.\" Subsequently, from 2000 onwards, Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation, operated on her four times and while able to improve her speaking voice, was unable to restore her singing.Despite the loss of her singing voice, she kept busy with many projects. In 1998, she appeared in a stage production of Dr. Dolittle in London. As recounted on the Julie Andrews website, she performed the voice of Polynesia the parrot and \"recorded some 700 sentences and sounds, which were placed on a computer chip that sat in the mechanical bird's mouth. In the song 'Talk to the Animals,' Polynesia the parrot even sings.\" The next year Andrews was reunited with James Garner for the CBS made-for-TV film, One Special Night, which aired in November 1999.\nIn the 2000 New Year Honours List, Andrews was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to the performing arts and received the award from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. In 2002, Andrews was among the guests at the Queen's Golden Jubilee Hollywood party held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She also appears at No.59 on the 2002 poll of the \"100 Greatest Britons\" sponsored by the BBC and chosen by the British public.In 2001, Andrews received Kennedy Center Honors. The same year, she reunited with Sound of Music co-star Christopher Plummer in a live television performance of On Golden Pond (an adaptation of the 1979 play).\n\n\n=== Career revival ===\nIn 2001, Andrews appeared in The Princess Diaries, her first Disney film since Mary Poppins. She starred as Queen Clarisse Marie Renaldi and reprised the role in the 2004 sequel, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. In the film, Andrews sang on film for the first time since having throat surgery. The song, \"Your Crowning Glory\", a duet with Raven-Symon\u00e9, was set in a limited range of an octave to accommodate her recovering voice. The film's music supervisor, Dawn Soler, recalled that Andrews \"nailed the song on the first take. I looked around and I saw grips with tears in their eyes.\"Andrews continued her association with Disney when she appeared as the nanny in two television films based on the Eloise books, a series of children's books by Kay Thompson about a child who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Eloise at the Plaza premiered in April 2003, and Eloise at Christmastime was broadcast in November 2003; Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award. The same year she made her debut as a theatre director, directing a revival of The Boy Friend, the musical in which she made her 1954 Broadway debut, at the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York. Her production, which featured costume and scenic design by her former husband Tony Walton, was remounted at the Goodspeed Opera House in 2005 and went on a national tour in 2006.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2006, Andrews served as the Official Ambassador for Disneyland's 18-month-long, 50th-anniversary celebration, the \"Happiest Homecoming on Earth\", travelling to promote the celebration, and recording narration and appearing at several events at the park. On 17 March 2005, Andrews appeared onstage during the curtain calls for the musical of Mary Poppins at the Prince Edward Theatre in London's West End, where she gave a speech recalling her own memories from making the film and praised the cast for their new interpretation.In 2004, Andrews voiced Queen Lillian in the animated blockbuster Shrek 2 (2004), reprising the role for its sequels, Shrek the Third (2007) and Shrek Forever After (2010). Also in 2007, she narrated Enchanted, a live-action Disney musical comedy that both parodied and paid homage to Disney films such as Mary Poppins.\nOn 1 May 2005, Disneyland debuted a new fireworks show, Remember... Dreams Come True, for Disneyland's 50th anniversary, with Andrews being the host and narrator of the show.\nIn January 2007, Andrews was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Screen Actors Guild's awards and stated that her goals included continuing to direct for the stage and possibly to produce her own Broadway musical. She published Home: A Memoir of My Early Years, which she characterised as \"part one\" of her autobiography, on 1 April 2008. Home chronicles her early years in Britain's music hall circuit and ends in 1962 with her winning the role of Mary Poppins. For a Walt Disney video release, she again portrayed Mary Poppins and narrated the story of The Cat That Looked at a King in 2004.\nFrom July until early August 2008, Andrews hosted Julie Andrews' The Gift of Music, a short tour of the United States where she sang various Rodgers and Hammerstein songs and symphonised her recently published book, Simeon's Gift. Appearances included the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, and a performance with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. These were her first public singing performances in a dozen years, due to her failed vocal cord surgery.In January 2009, Andrews was named on The Times' list of the top 10 British Actresses of all time. The list included Helen Mirren, Helena Bonham Carter, Judi Dench, and Audrey Hepburn. On 8 May 2009, Andrews received the honorary George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Achievement in Music at the annual UCLA Spring Sing competition in Pauley Pavilion.\n\n\n=== 2010\u2013present ===\n\nIn January 2010, Andrews was the official United States presenter for the Great Performances From Vienna: The New Year's Celebration 2010 concert. This was her second appearance in this role, after presenting the previous year's concert. Andrews also had a supporting role in the film Tooth Fairy, which opened to unfavourable reviews although the box office receipts were successful. On her promotion tour for the film, she also spoke of Operation USA and the aid campaign to the Haiti disaster.On 8 May 2010, Andrews made her London comeback after a 21-year absence (her last performance there was a Christmas concert at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989). She performed at The O2 Arena, accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and an ensemble of five performers. Earlier (on 15 December 2009 and on many other occasions), she appeared on British television saying that rumours that she would be singing at the performance were not true and that she would be doing a form of \"speak singing\". Yet she actually sang two solos and several duets and ensemble pieces. The evening, though well received by the 20,000 fans present, who gave her standing ovation after standing ovation, did not convince the critics.On 18 May 2010, Andrews' 23rd book (this one also written with her daughter Emma) was published. In June 2010, the book, entitled The Very Fairy Princess, reached number 1 on The New York Times Best Seller List for Children's Books. On 21 May 2010, her film Shrek Forever After was released; in it Andrews reprises her role as the Queen. On 9 July 2010, Despicable Me, an animated film in which Andrews lent her voice to Marlena Gru, the thoughtless and soul-crushing mother of the main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), opened to rave reviews and strong box office.On 28 October 2010, Andrews appeared, along with the actors who portrayed the cinematic von Trapp family members, on Oprah to commemorate the film's 45th anniversary. A few days later, her 24th book, Little Bo in Italy, was published. On 15 December 2010, Andrews' husband Blake Edwards died at the age of 88, of complications of pneumonia at the Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Andrews was by her husband's side when he died.\n\nIn February 2011, Andrews received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and, with her daughter Emma, a Grammy for best spoken-word album for children (for A Collection of Poems, Songs and Lullabies), at the 53rd Grammy Awards.In her memoir, Home Work (2019), Andrews discussed being offered the role of Aunt Emma by Martin Scorsese for his film The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). Unfortunately, she declined citing a recent surgery and she wasn't \"ready to go back to work\" but \"would've loved to have done it\".At the age of 77, Andrews undertook her first tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2013, hosted by Nicholas Hammond who was a boy of 14 when they appeared together in The Sound of Music. In place of singing, she planned a series of speaking engagements in Australia's five mainland state capitals.  The following year she took the show on a tour of England, which was hosted by Aled Jones. The tour began with a May date at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham and included an appearance at the Echo Arena in Liverpool.In 2015, Andrews made a surprise appearance at the Oscars, greeting Lady Gaga who paid her homage by singing a medley from The Sound of Music. This became a social media sensation, trending all over the world. Lyndon Terracini announced in August 2015 that Andrews would direct My Fair Lady in 2016 for Opera Australia at the Sydney Opera House.In 2016, Andrews created the preschool television series Julie's Greenroom with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton and Judy Rothman. Andrews is joined by her assistant Gus (Giullian Yao Gioiello) and \u201cGreenies,\u201d a cast of original puppets built by The Jim Henson Company. The series premiered on Netflix in 2017. In 2017, Andrews also reprised her role as Marlena Gru in the second Despicable Me sequel Despicable Me 3. In 2018, Andrews voiced Karathen, a leviathan, in James Wan's Aquaman. That same year, she declined a cameo appearance in Mary Poppins Returns to avoid stealing the limelight now belonging to star Emily Blunt.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAndrews has been married twice, first to set designer Tony Walton from 1959 until 1967, then to director Blake Edwards from 1969 until his death in 2010.Andrews married Walton on 10 May 1959 in Weybridge, Surrey. They had first met in 1948 when Andrews was appearing at the London Casino in the show Humpty Dumpty. In September 1962, Andrews and Walton returned to London, where their daughter Emma Katherine Walton was born two months later.Andrews married Edwards in 1969; his children from a previous marriage, Jennifer and Geoffrey, were 3 and 5 years older than Emma. In the 1970s, Edwards and Andrews adopted two Vietnamese daughters; Amy (later known as Amelia) in 1974 and Joanna in 1975. Andrews is a grandmother to nine and great-grandmother to three.\n\n\n== Voice ==\n\nTermed \"Britain's youngest prima donna\", Andrews' classically trained soprano voice, lauded for its \"pure and clear\" sound, has been described as light, bright and operatic in tone. When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a throat specialist, the doctor concluded that she had \"an almost adult larynx.\" In spite of her voice teacher, English soprano Lilian Stiles-Allen, having continually encouraged her to pursue opera, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and \"too big a stretch\". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as \"extremely high and thin\", feeling that it lacked \"the necessary guts and weight for opera\", preferring musical theatre instead. As she aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her \"top notes\" became increasingly difficult to sing while \"her middle register matured into the warm golden tone\" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of The Daily Telegraph.Musically, Andrews had always preferred singing music that was \"bright and sunny\", choosing to avoid songs that were sad, depressing, upsetting, or written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice \"in a mess of emotion\". She cited this as another reason for avoiding opera.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n==== Box Office Ranking ====\n\n1965 - 4th (US), 3rd (UK)\n1966 - 1st (US), 8th (UK)\n1967 - 1st (US)\n1968 - 3rd (US), 8th (UK)\n1969 - 19th (US), 8th (UK)\n1970 - 19th (US)\n1982 - 25th (US)\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Stage ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n=== Academy Awards ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Golden Globe Awards ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Grammy Awards ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Emmy Award ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Tony Awards ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\u2020 Andrews declined the nomination for her role in Victor/Victoria, citing that she felt that the rest of the company had been overlooked.\n\n\n=== BAFTA Awards ===\nA ^  The Americanization of Emily was released in 1965 in the UK (1964 in the US).\n\n\n=== Screen Actors Guild Awards ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Drama Desk Awards ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Hollywood Walk of Fame ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Kennedy Center Honors ===\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\n\n\n=== Other awards ===\n\n\n=== Honorary degrees ===\nAndrews has received many honorary degrees in recognition of her distinguished career in entertainment.

The course will start with discussions regarding the origins of the modern social sciences and the disputes about the nature of social science knowledge. In the next section it will focus on definitions and debates about the concept of modernity. It will go on to analyses of some fundamental concepts used in modern social and historical analyses: concepts of social action, political concepts like state, power, hegemony, democracy, nationalism; economic concepts like the economy, labor, market, capitalism, and related concepts of secularity/secularism, representation, and identity. The teaching will be primarily through close reading of set texts, followed by a discussion.

She became member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong for New Territories East in 2016.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nYung was born in Hong Kong in 1977 and was educated at St. Francis' Canossian College and Rosaryhill School. She went on to study computer science at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and graduated in 2001. Unsuccessful in her bid to begin her chosen career as a gaming programmer, she stayed on as a research assistant and helped develop a journal research programme at UBC. After she returned to Hong Kong in the summer of 2003, she studied law at the City University of Hong Kong and qualified as a barrister in 2008.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nYung became a volunteer legal consultant of the New Home Association, a pro-Beijing non-governmental organisation that helps mainland Chinese immigrants and ethnic minorities integrate into Hong Kong society. She was also founding member of the Hong Kong Professionals and Senior Executives Association, a pro-Beijing professionals' association where she broadened her social circle by meeting with political and business figures. In 2015, she founded the Youth and Professional Network to help young people with start-ups.Yung joined Civil Force (CF), a pro-Beijing Sha Tin-based political group that formed an alliance with the New People's Party (NPP) in February 2014, effecting the expansion of Regina Ip's party from Hong Kong Island to New Territories East.In 2016, Yung became the NPP\u2013CF candidate in the Legislative Council election, leading a seven-member ticket in New Territories East and won a seat with 36,183 votes.\n\n\n== Political views ==\nIn securing her Legislative Council seat, Yung is widely considered to have received support from the central government's liaison office based in Sai Wan, with which she has confessed a \"working relationship\", earning her the nickname, \"Goddaughter of Sai Wan\".  She is best known for her interest in the promotion of e-sports and her statement that \"there should not be too much politics inside or outside of the legislature\".  She considers Regina Ip her political mentor.In May 2018, Eunice Yung caused controversy by stating that domestic workers in Hong Kong often gather in large groups in public areas, thus they affect the hygiene and daily lives of other members of the public and nearby shops. She suggested the government should segregate them by providing additional activity centres for them. Several groups representing Hong Kong\u2019s domestic workers including The International Migrants Alliance, Asian Migrants Coordinating Body and Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions condemned the remarks as racist against migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong, saying it contributed to discrimination against ethnic minorities. A few days later, around 150 people from the same groups held a protest outside the New People's Party Headquarters calling Yung to retract her remarks and apologise. Yung met with the protesters briefly and apologised for her remarks causing 'disrespect'.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nYung is an avid gamer, describing herself as a \"tech girl\".Yung married Derek Yuen Mi-chang, the policy director of New People's Party, in August 2018.

In 1936, Thunderstorm debuted in Nanjing, with Cao Yu himself acting in the lead role.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe subject matter of Thunderstorm is the disastrous effects of rigid traditionalism and hypocrisy on the wealthy, modern, somewhat Westernized Zhou family. Specifically, the plot of Thunderstorm centers on the Zhou family's psychological and physical destruction as a result of incest and oppression, caused by its morally depraved and corrupt patriarch, Zhou Puyuan, a wealthy businessman.\nThe following synopsis is based on the complete version of the play (the prologue and epilogue are usually omitted from performances):Prologue\nTwo children stumble into the former Zhou mansion, now a hospital operated by Catholic nuns. The hospital is inhabited by two mentally disturbed patients, one a silent and morose old woman and another a younger, violently hysterical woman. An elderly man named \"old Mr Zhou\" visits them. Through the dialogue between the nurses, it is revealed that old Mr Zhou is the husband of the younger patient, that three people died in this house ten years before in a tragedy and as a result the house is rumoured to be haunted. Towards the end of the prologue the old woman walks to the window, and falls.\nAct I\nThe scene goes back to the summer of 1925, when the tragedy happened at the Zhou mansion. Lu Gui and his daughter Sifeng, both servants of the Zhou household, are seen conversing in the drawing room. Lu Gui tells Sifeng about a secret affair between the old master's wife Fanyi and her stepson Zhou Ping. Sifeng is shocked to learn this because she and Zhou Ping are in a romantic relationship. Lu Gui also tells Sifeng that Fanyi invited her mother Mrs Lu to the house, possibly wishing to dismiss Sifeng for her involvement with Zhou Ping.\nA cough is heard and Fanyi enters. She is described as a refined and physically fragile woman with a passionate and resolute spirit. She learns from Sifeng that the old master had just returned from the mine a few days ago. She also questions Sifeng about Zhou Ping, showing great concern about him and jealousy at Sifeng.\nZhou Chong, Fanyi's 17-year-old son returns from a game of tennis and excitedly tells Fanyi about his newfound love for Sifeng. He even wants to share his school allowance with her so she can attend school. Fanyi is shocked and unhappy to learn that her son had fallen for a low-class girl, but is happy to see her son's brave insistence to pursue love in spite of difficulty. Chong also tells Fanyi that Ping told him \"he once loved a woman he should never have loved\".\nZhou Ping enters the room. He shows extreme discomfort at the sight of Fanyi. Soon afterward Zhou Puyuan, the old master and mine owner, enters with an air of authority. He tells the family of a workers' strike at the mine and reacts angrily when Chong sympathizes with the workers. Puyuan commands Fanyi to drink a traditional Chinese medicine concoction that he had ordered for her to cure her \"mental imbalance\". When Fanyi refuses, he becomes furious and orders Zhou Ping and Zhou Chong to kneel down and beg her to drink it. Eventually Fanyi relents, gulps down the medicine and leaves the room crying.\nAfter the other people have exited the room, Zhou Puyuan reproaches Zhou Ping for \"behaving dishonourably\". Zhou Ping is petrified as he assumes Puyuan is referring to his affairs with women in the household. To his surprise Puyuan merely expresses disapproval at his habit of heavy drinking and going to dance halls. Puyuan reminisces about a woman named Shiping, whose photograph he displays in the drawing room. In Puyuan's words, she is Zhou Ping's birth mother who supposedly died many years ago.\nAct II\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ping secretly meets Sifeng in the drawing room and tells her of his plans to leave his home permanently to work at his father's business in the country. Sifeng begs him not to leave her behind. Ping assures her of his love for her but does not respond to her plea. Instead he arranges to meet Sifeng at her house that evening.\nFanyi enters after Sifeng has left and attempts to dissuade Ping from leaving the house and abandoning her. She tells him that she is unable to cope with Puyuan's abuse and expresses longing for Ping, and when Ping shows indifference, she angrily accuses both him and his father of hypocrisy and irresponsibility. Meanwhile, Ping expresses his regret for ever being involved with Fanyi and refuses to ever have anything to do with her again. The two end up in a heated argument and Ping leaves.\nSifeng's mother Mrs Lu, a kind and beautiful woman, arrives for her appointment with Fanyi. Mrs Lu recognises herself in the photograph, implying that she is Shiping, Zhou Ping's birth mother and Puyuan's ex-wife. She does not communicate this information to Sifeng. In their meeting, Fanyi tells Mrs Lu that Zhou Chong is in love with Sifeng, and urges her to take Sifeng home to avoid potential scandal. Mrs Lu agrees to this request.\nPuyuan advises Fanyi that a psychiatrist has arrived to see Fanyi at his request. After she storms off in anger, he engages in conversation with Mrs Lu. After learning that she used to live in Wuxi, where he lived in his youth, he asks her if she knew where Shiping's grave is. Mrs Lu calmly tells him that although Shiping attempted suicide after being driven out of the Zhou family and leaving her first child (Zhou Ping) behind, she survived, gave birth to her and Puyuan's second son soon afterwards and married a poor man, who later became the father of her daughter. Eventually she reveals to Zhou Puyuan that she is indeed Shiping, who used to be a servant at the Zhou household where she had a relationship with Puyuan. Puyuan offers her money to atone for his sins, but she refuses and says she had decided to leave the city with her husband and daughter. Puyuan also learns from Shiping that their second son Lu Dahai is now working at his mine and is a leader in the workers' protests.\nLu Dahai, not knowing that Puyuan is his father, arrives at the Zhou house and confronts Puyuan over his exploitation of workers. Puyuan tells him that all other representatives have agreed to call off the strike and that everyone has gone back to work except him. Lu Dahai is furious and insults Puyuan but is punched by Zhou Ping and pushed away by the servants. Mrs Lu exits with Dahai.\nBoth Sifeng and Lu Gui are dismissed from the Zhou household. Fanyi learns of Ping's plan to visit Sifeng at her house and asks him not to go, saying that Sifeng is a lower-class woman not worthy of him. She ominously tells him that \"A thunderstorm is coming\", hinting at her plans for revenge.\nAct III\nThe scene opens at Sifeng's house that evening, where Lu Gui unfairly accuses Dahai of causing his and Sifeng's dismissal and a brief family argument ensues. After Dahai and Mrs Lu leave, Lu Gui attempts to dissuade Sifeng from leaving the city with her mother.\nA knock is heard and Zhou Chong arrives to visit Sifeng. He apologizes for what happened that afternoon and offers one hundred dollars to Lu Gui as compensation. He tells Sifeng that although she turned down his proposal of marriage, he still wants to be friends with her and would like to use his allowance to pay for her schooling. He also tells her about his dream of a world where there is no conflict and everyone is equal.\nLu Dahai returns and mistakenly thinks Chong is here to seduce Sifeng. Still angry over the events of the afternoon, he threatens Chong to never visit them again or he will break Chong's leg. Chong naively tries to explain his sympathy for the lower classes and offers to shake hands with Dahai. Eventually he gives up and returns to the Zhou mansion, his illusions half-shattered.\nMrs Lu also mistakenly assumes that Sifeng and Chong are in love. Thinking of her own early experience with Puyuan, she warns Sifeng to stay away from the men of the Zhou family, not realising that Sifeng is already in a relationship with Ping, her half-brother.\nIt is now midnight and Zhou Ping climbs through the window to visit Sifeng in her room. The lovers embrace. Fanyi's face appears briefly at the window. They are interrupted when Dahai enters the room to find bed planks. Mrs Lu begs Dahai not to hurt Ping. Zhou Ping escapes and Sifeng runs off in shame.  Concerned about her safety, the family goes after her in the rain.\nAct IV\nIt is 2am at the Zhou's living room, where Puyuan is reading over his work documents alone. Chong enters searching for his mother. Puyuan attempts to repair his relationship with Chong by talking to him, but Chong draws away in discomfort. Fanyi enters from the rain and acts coldly towards Puyuan. She even mocks him when he tells her to go to her room.\nPing and Fanyi now find themselves alone in the drawing room after returning from the Lu's. In a disturbed state, Fanyi accuses Ping and his father of conspiring against her and driving her insane. Abandoning all restraint, she begs Ping to take her to the country, even if Sifeng comes with them. Although Ping appears to be overtaken by guilt, he refuses and storms out of the room. Fanyi calmly tears up Shiping's picture.\nLu Dahai arrives at the Zhou's house searching for Sifeng and encounters Ping. He accuses Ping of ruining his sister's life and threatens to shoot him. Ping professes his love for Sifeng and promises that he will return and marry her. Dahai backs off after remembering his mother's warning against harming the Zhou family, and gives his pistol to Zhou Ping.\nSifeng enters and is reunited with Ping, followed by Mrs Lu. Ping asks Sifeng to leave for the countryside with him immediately and she agrees. Mrs Lu, who is aware of their true status as half-siblings, does all she can to prevent them. Sifeng reveals that she is already pregnant with Zhou Ping's child. Seeing that nothing can be undone, Mrs Lu agrees under the condition that they flee as far as possible and never return.\nAs they are about to exit, Fanyi enters with Chong in a desperate attempt at revenge. She tells Chong of Sifeng's relationship with Ping, hoping to inspire jealousy between the brothers. To her surprise Chong says that he is not really in love with Sifeng after all and wishes Sifeng a happy life with Ping. Having had her hopes shattered once more, Fanyi abandons all maternal sentiments and furiously tells everyone of her affair with Ping and his betrayal. Desperate, she calls for Puyuan to come and look at his son.\nPuyuan enters and, unaware of the romance between Ping and Sifeng, reveals that Mrs Lu is indeed Ping's mother and Sifeng and Ping are half-siblings. A deadly silence follows. Unable to face the truth, Sifeng runs outside, followed by Chong. They are both electrocuted after running into a broken electric wire. As Puyuan, Fanyi and Mrs Lu try to comprehend the loss of their children, a gunshot is heard as Zhou Ping commits suicide.\nEpilogue\nBack in the hospital ten years later, old Mr Zhou (Puyuan) asks a nun about the old woman (Mrs Lu). He tells the nun that he had been searching for the old woman's son Lu Dahai for ten years with no result. He approaches the old woman and calls out her name, but she does not respond. He is disappointed and sits down, gazing at the fire.\n\n\n== Historical significance ==\nAlthough it is undisputed that the prodigious reputation achieved by Thunderstorm was due in large part to its scandalous public airing of the topic of incest, and many people have pointed out not inconsiderable technical imperfections in its structure, Thunderstorm is nevertheless considered to be a milestone in China's modern theatrical ascendancy. Even those who have questioned the literary prowess of Cao Yu, for instance, the noted critic C. T. Hsia, admit that the popularization and consolidation of China's theatrical genre is fundamentally owed to the first works of Cao Yu.\n\n\n== Comparative perspective ==\nThunderstorm bears comparison with other works of ancient and contemporary drama, particularly drama dealing with the way the past haunts the present. In particular, Thunderstorm bears a strong resemblance in plot, themes, characterization, pacing and tone to the plays of Henrik Ibsen.  For instance, Thunderstorm shares with Ibsen's Ghosts elements such as a respected patriarch who has, in fact, impregnated his servant, a romance between his children (who do not know that they are half-siblings), and a climactic revelation of this situation in the play. More generally, the book relates to the genre of classical tragedy, particularly the Oedipus cycle and other plays of Sophocles.\n\n\n== English translations ==\nThunderstorm was published in 1958 in an English translation by Wang Tso-liang and A.C. Barnes by Foreign Languages Press (Beijing). University Press of the Pacific published an English translation in 2001.\n\n\n== Other adaptations and related works ==\nIn 1938, after the play's theatrical triumphs, a film version was produced in Shanghai. Another film version was made in Hong Kong in 1957 (Lei Yu, dir. Ng Wui), which co-starred a young Bruce Lee in one of his few non-fighting roles. In 1995, Director Ho Yi produced a Cantonese film version in, with the personal blessing of the playwright. This film was released in 1996.\nHangzhou-born composer Mo Fan composed a modern Chinese opera based on the play, with the same title (Leiyu, \"Thunderstorm\"). The opera was presented in 2001 by the Shanghai Opera House company.Another adaptation was the 2006 film Curse of the Golden Flower, directed and written by Zhang Yimou. This very loose adaptation set the action in the imperial court of the late Tang Dynasty, with the Emperor in the place of Puyuan.\nIn 2012 Wang Chong directed Thunderstorm 2.0, a multimedia performance using four cameras and real-time editing, in Trojan House, Beijing. The adaptation, authorised by Cao Yu's family, cut 99% of the original text and only three major characters remained. The focus became Cao Yu's feminist view. The show was an immediate hit. The Beijing News noted it as one of the Best Ten Little Theater Works in China 1982\u20132012. It later toured Taipei Arts Festival, Israel Festival in Jerusalem, and Under the Radar Festival in New York, three festivals that no performance from China mainland has ever entered.\n\n\n== Anthologies ==\nIt is included in The Columbia Anthology of Modern Chinese Drama, a 2010 book edited by Xiaomei Chen and published by the Columbia University Press. Kevin J. Wetmore, Jr. of Loyola Marymount University stated that this inclusion was \"I believe, for the first time\" Thunderstorm was included in an anthology.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nZhou Puyuan (T: \u5468\u6a38\u5712, S: \u5468\u6734\u56ed, P: Zh\u014du P\u01d4yu\u00e1n, S: Chou P'u-y\u00fcan): 55-year-old head of a mining company.\nFanyi (\u7e41\u6f2a, P: F\u00e1ny\u012b, W: Fan-i): Puyuan's second wife, 35 years old.\nZhou Ping (\u5468 \u840d, P: Zh\u014du P\u00edng, W: Chou P'ing): Puyuan's elder son (by Shiping), 28 years old.\nZhou Chong (T: \u5468\u3000\u6c96, S: \u5468 \u51b2, P: Zh\u014du Ch\u014dng, W: Chou Ch'ung): Puyuan's youngest son (by Fanyi), 17 years old son.\nLu Gui (T: \u9b6f \u8cb4, S: \u9c81 \u8d35, P: L\u01d4 Gu\u00ec, W: Lu Kuei): manservant in the Zhou household, 48 years old.\nLu Shiping (T: \u9b6f\u4f8d\u840d, S: \u9c81\u4f8d\u840d, P: L\u01d4 Sh\u00ecp\u00edng, W: Lu Shih-p'ing): former wife of Puyuan and wife of Lu Gui, 47 years old.\nLu Dahai (T: \u9b6f\u5927\u6d77, S: \u9c81\u5927\u6d77, P: L\u01d4 D\u00e0h\u01cei, W: Lu Ta-hai): son of Puyuan by Shiping, 27 years old.\nLu Sifeng (T: \u9b6f\u56db\u9cf3, S: \u9c81\u56db\u51e4, P: L\u01d4 S\u00ecf\u00e8ng, W: Lu Ssu-feng): maidservant in the Zhou household, daughter of Lu Gui and Shiping, 18 years old.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nTranslation of The Thunderstorm (Archive) by Genevieve Andreas, Haverford College\nCharacter profiles", "label": 0}

He was leader for more than 30 recordings and played as a sideman on more than 300.After early experiences backing blues musicians, Hicks moved to New York in 1963. He was part of Art Blakey's band for two years, then backed vocalist Betty Carter from 1965 to 1967, before joining Woody Herman's big band, where he stayed until 1970. Following these largely mainstream jazz experiences, Hicks expanded into freer bands, including those of trumpeters Charles Tolliver and Lester Bowie. He rejoined Carter in 1975; the five-year stay brought him more attention and helped to launch his recording career as a leader. He continued to play and record extensively in the United States and internationally. Under his own leadership, his recordings were mostly bebop-influenced, while those for other leaders continued to be in a diversity of styles, including multi-year associations with saxophonists Arthur Blythe, David Murray, David \"Fathead\" Newman, and Pharoah Sanders.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHicks was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 21, 1941, the oldest of five children.

His family was middle class; \"I was brought up as a decent human being, where you had aspirations and there were expectations\", he commented. He began playing the piano aged six or seven in Los Angeles. His mother, Pollie, was his first piano teacher. He also took organ lessons, sang in choirs and tried the violin and trombone. He began playing the piano in church once he could read music, around the age of 11. His development accelerated once his family moved to St. Louis, when Hicks was 14 and he settled on the piano. In St. Louis, he attended Sumner High School. While there, he played in schoolmate Lester Bowie's band, the Continentals. Hicks cited influences \"from Fats Waller to Thelonious Monk to Methodist church hymns\", as well as local pianists. He was initially interested in the blues-based compositions of Horace Silver and popular songs such as \"I Got Rhythm\" and \"There Will Never Be Another You\", for their easily recognised harmonies.Hicks had summer gigs in the southern United States with blues musicians Little Milton and Albert King. His stint with Little Milton provided his first professional work, in 1958; Hicks stated that his playing in a variety of keys improved because the venue's piano was so out of tune that he had to transpose each piece that they played. Hicks studied music in 1958 at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where he shared a room with drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson. He also studied for a short time at the Berklee School of Music in Boston before moving to New York in 1963.\n\n\n== Later life and career ==\n\n\n=== 1963\u201380 ===\nIn New York, Hicks first accompanied singer Della Reese. He then played with Joe Farrell and toured with trombonist Al Grey and tenor saxophonist Billy Mitchell. In 1963 he was also part of saxophonist Pharoah Sanders' first band, and appeared on CBC Television backing vocalist Jimmy Witherspoon. After periods with Kenny Dorham and Joe Henderson, Hicks joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1964. His recording debut was with Blakey in November that year, for the album 'S Make It. Early in 1965, Hicks toured with Blakey to Japan, France, Switzerland, and England. Blakey encouraged his band members, including Hicks, to compose for the band, although they also played compositions by previous members of the band. He stayed with Blakey for two years, during which time his playing was compared with that of McCoy Tyner, for the level of energy displayed and for some of the intervals that they used.\n\nIn the period 1965 to 1967 Hicks worked on and off with vocalist Betty Carter; her liking for slow ballads helped him develop his sense of time. He then joined Woody Herman's big band, where he stayed until 1970, playing as well as writing arrangements for the band. Hicks \"also recorded with Booker Ervin and Sonny Simmons (both 1966), Hank Mobley (1967), and Lee Morgan (1968)\". From 1972 to 1973 Hicks taught jazz history and improvisation at Southern Illinois University. From the 1970s he also played in more avant garde bands. \"He recorded with Oliver Lake (1970) and performed and recorded in the Netherlands with Charles Tolliver (1972).\" He played with Blakey again in 1973. Hicks' debut recording as leader was on May 21, 1975, in England. The session resulted in two albums \u2013 the trio Hells Bells, with bassist Clint Houston and drummer Cliff Barbaro, and the piano solo Steadfast. They were released by Strata-East Records, but not for several years: Hells Bells emerged in 1978 or 1980.Hicks reunited with Carter in 1975, including accompanying her in a musical play, Don't Call Me Man, that year. After recording with Carter on her Now It's My Turn in 1976, Hicks returned to her band full-time; this raised his profile and led to his own recording \u2013 After the Morning. His recording continued, including with \"Lester Bowie (1974), Carter Jefferson (1978), and Chico Freeman (1978\u201379).\" Hicks was dismissed in 1980 by Carter, a forceful bandleader, for drinking.\n\n\n=== 1981\u201389 ===\nSome Other Time in 1981, with bassist Walter Booker and drummer Idris Muhammad, revealed more of Hicks as a composer, and included his best-known song, \"Naima's Love Song\".\"Hicks led bands from the mid-1970s. His small groups included a quartet of Sonny Fortune, Walter Booker, and Jimmy Cobb (1975\u201382, from 1990); a trio, without Fortune (from 1981); a quartet or trio, with the flutist Elise Wood added or replacing the drummer; another quartet, with the addition of Gary Bartz; a different trio with Curtis Lundy or Ray Drummond on double bass and Idris Muhammad on drums; quartets involving various of these musicians, as well as Watson, Blythe, Murray, Herring, or Craig Handy, and with Victor Lewis added to the pool of drummers; quintets and sextets whose members have also involved Robin Eubanks and Tolliver (both from 1982), Branford Marsalis (1982\u20134), Hannibal Peterson (from 1983), Wynton Marsalis (1983\u20134), Craig Harris (1985\u20136), Eddie Henderson (1985\u20136, 1988\u201390), and Freeman (1985\u20138); and a big band (formed in autumn 1982 and revived on occasion into the late 1990s)\". He played in the UK with Freeman's band in 1989.From 1983, the flautist Elise Wood was frequently a member of his groups. As a duo, they played mostly jazz, but also some classical music. They formed a business partnership \u2013 John Hicks-Elise Wood, Inc. \u2013 and toured the US, Europe and Japan in the 1980s.From the early 1980s until his death he performed solo and led his own groups, including the Keystone Trio, with Idris Muhammad and George Mraz. He also freelanced, including with more contemporary players such as Arthur Blythe, David Murray, and Pharoah Sanders. \"During the 1980s Hicks played as a sideman in numerous groups, including those led by Richie Cole (1980), Arthur Blythe (In the Tradition), David Murray, Hamiet Bluiett, Art Davis, and Pharoah Sanders; he recorded with these musicians, as well as with Ricky Ford (1980, 1982), Alvin Queen (1981), Peter Leitch (1984), Vincent Herring (1986), and Bobby Watson (1986, 1988)\". In 1984 he had a big band that rehearsed; a sextet from it played concerts. From around 1989 into the 1990s he played with the Mingus Dynasty band, including for performances of the symphony Epitaph. He recorded two albums in Japan in 1988 \u2013 the trio East Side Blues and the quartet Naima's Love Song, with altoist Bobby Watson added. He became \"a fixture at international music festivals\" as well as continuing to play in New York.\n\n\n=== 1990\u20132006 ===\nHicks divorced his wife, Olympia, in the early 1990s. The couple had a son and daughter (Jamil Malik and Naima).\"Like so many straight-ahead jazz artists, John Hicks did his share of label-hopping in the '90s. Instead of recording for one company consistently, he would offer different projects to different labels.\" He continued to record in the 1990s, including \"in duos with Drummond (1989), Jay McShann (1992), and Leitch (1994); as a leader; in cooperative sessions with Kenny Barron (1989), Cecil McBee and Elvin Jones (as the Power Trio, 1990), with George Mraz and Muhammad (as the Keystone Trio, from 1995), and with Eric Alexander, Mraz, and Muhammad (1998); and further as a sideman with Murray, Leitch, Blythe, and Freeman, as well as with Roy Hargrove (1989\u201390, 1995), Bartz (1990), Lake (1991), Steve Marcus and Valery Ponomarev (both 1993), Nick Brignola, Russell Gunn, and Kevin Mahogany (all 1994), the Mingus Big Band (c1995), Fortune (1996), and Jimmy Ponder (1997).\" As leader, his choice of material in the 1990s was often of commonly played standards. He played in the UK with the Mingus Big Band in 1999, and played on their album Blues and Politics from the same year.His most commercially successful recordings were tributes to other musicians, including Something to Live For (1998), Impressions of Mary Lou (2000), and Fatha's Day (2003). There were five such albums, all linked to Pittsburgh-associated pianist-composers; the other two were Nightwind: An Erroll Garner Songbook, and Music in the Key of Clark.Hicks played and recorded with jazz artists such as Joe Lovano and David \"Fathead\" Newman. He played on five of Newman's albums for HighNote Records. He was described in 2000 as the \"HighNote house pianist\". The pianist recorded the seventh instalment of the \"Live at Maybeck Recital Hall\" series of solo concerts, which were recorded for Concord Records. He was part of Lovano's quartet in 1998, which led to Hicks being part of the saxophonist's nonet from its formation the following year.Hicks and Wood married in 2001. He made a rare recording on organ (Hammond B3) on saxophonist Arthur Blythe's Exhale. \"over the last 12 years [of his life, he] released several collaborations with his wife Elise Wood to mixed reviews (Single Petal of a Rose, Trio & Strings, Beautiful Friendship)\".Towards the end of his life, Hicks taught at New York University and The New School in New York. Asked about his teaching, Hicks replied that \"I don't care how advanced my students are, I always start them off with the blues. It all comes from there.\" Early in 2006 Hicks again played in a big band, this time led by Charles Tolliver. In January and February, he toured Israel, chiefly playing Thelonious Monk compositions. Hicks' final studio recording was On the Wings of an Eagle in March 2006. His last performance was at St Mark's United Methodist Church in New York City a few days before he died. He died on May 10, 2006, from internal bleeding. Hicks is buried at South-View Cemetery in his hometown of Atlanta.Wood survived him, and has led a band dedicated to his music. In the view of AllMusic reviewer Michael G. Nastos, \"Hicks died before reaping the ultimate rewards and high praise he deserved\". A collection of his papers and compositions, as well as video and audio recordings, is held by Duke University.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nHicks had a style of his own, containing a \"combination of irresistible creativity and responsiveness [...] encompassing swing, hard bop and the avant garde, and made him a first-call choice for many of the most important American modern jazz groups\". \"Hicks had his critics, some of whom condemn him for insubstantiality.\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz commented that \"This [...] is missing the point. Almost always, he is more concerned to work within the dimensions of a song than to go off into the stratosphere.\"A reviewer of a 1993 release, Lover Man: A Tribute to Billie Holiday, commented that Hicks \"mastered the technique of shaping a piano chord so it sounds like the rising and falling of a breath\". Fellow pianist George Cables stated that Hicks \"was a very strong and energetic player, and a very warm player, very much part of the tradition\". His \"left hand carries subtle dynamic shadings [... He has] a reverence for melody and a sense of musical destination that gives form to his improvisations.\"As an accompanist, Hicks played delicately, with carefully voiced chords.\n\n\n== Compositions and arrangements ==\nHis compositions \"are wandering and melodic, suggestive and malleable yet memorable\". He \"enjoyed writing arrangements for a quintet or sextet, often, like the finest jazz composers, tailoring parts to specific musicians. In the past, these have included artists of the caliber of Bobby Watson and Vincent Herring; more recently he has been working with Javon Jackson and Elise [Wood]\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAn asterisk (*) after the year indicates that it is the year of release.\n\n\n=== As leader/co-leader ===\n\n\n=== As sideman ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography", "label": 0}

He is best known as a quantitative analyst, and author of the book My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance.He is a co-author of Black\u2013Derman\u2013Toy model, one of the first interest-rate models, and the Derman\u2013Kani local volatility or implied tree model, a model consistent with the volatility smile.\nDerman, who first came to the U.S. at age 21, in 1966, is currently a professor at Columbia University and Director of its program in financial engineering. Until recently he was also the Head of Risk and a partner at KKR Prisma Capital Partners, a fund of funds. His book My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance, published by Wiley in September 2004, was one of Business Week's top ten books of the year for 2004. In 2011, he published Models.Behaving.Badly, a book contrasting financial models with the theories of hard science, and also containing some autobiographical material.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn to a South African Jewish family, Derman obtained a B.Sc. (Hons) at the University of Cape Town, and received a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Columbia in 1973, where he wrote a thesis that proposed a test for a weak-neutral current in electron-hadron scattering. This experiment was carried out at SLAC in 1978 by a team led by Charles Prescott and Richard Taylor, and confirmed the Weinberg\u2013Salam model. Between 1973 and 1980 he did research in theoretical particle physics at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Oxford, Rockefeller University and the University of Colorado at Boulder. From 1980 to 1985 he worked at AT&T Bell Laboratories, where he developed computer languages for business modeling applications.\nIn 1985 Derman joined Goldman Sachs' fixed income division where he was one of the co-developers of the Black\u2013Derman\u2013Toy interest-rate model.\nHe left Goldman Sachs at the end of 1988 to take a position at Salomon Brothers Inc. as head of Adjustable Rate Mortgage Research in the Bond Portfolio Analysis group.\nRehired by Goldman Sachs, from 1990 to 2000 he led the Quantitative Strategies group in the Equities division, which pioneered the study of local volatility models and the volatility smile.  He was appointed a managing director of Goldman Sachs in 1997. In 2000, he became head of the firm\u2019s Quantitative Risk Strategies group.  He retired from Goldman Sachs in 2002 and took a position at Columbia University and Prisma Capital Partners (acquired by KKR) .\nDerman was named the IAFE/SunGard Financial Engineer of the Year 2000, and was elected to the Risk Hall of Fame in 2002. He is the author of numerous articles on quantitative finance on the topics of volatility and the nature of financial modeling.\nSince 1995, Derman has written many articles pointing out the essential difference between models in physics and models in finance. Good models in physics aim to predict the future accurately from the present, or to predict new previously unobserved phenomena; models in finance are used mostly to estimate the values of illiquid securities from liquid ones. Models in physics deal with objective variables; models in finance deal with subjective ones. \u201cIn physics there may one day be a Theory of Everything; in finance and the social sciences, you\u2019re lucky if there is a usable theory of anything.\u201d\nDerman together with Paul Wilmott wrote the Financial Modelers' Manifesto, a set of principles for doing responsible financial modeling.From February 2011 to July 2012, Derman wrote a financial blog for Reuters. Beginning in September 2012, for one year, Derman wrote a regular column for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\n\n== Models.Behaving.Badly ==\nIn 2011, Derman published a new book titled Models.Behaving.Badly: Why Confusing Illusion With Reality Can Lead to Disaster, on Wall Street and in Life. In that work he decries the breakdown of capitalism as a model during the bailouts characterizing the  2008 financial crisis and calls for a return to principles, to the notion that if you want to take a chance on the upside, you have also taken a chance on the downside.\nMore generally, he analyzes three ways of understanding the behavior of the world: models, theory and intuition. Models, he argues, are merely metaphors that compare something you would like to understand with something you already do. Models provide relative knowledge. Theories, in contrast, are attempts to understand the world on absolute terms; while models stand on someone else's legs, theories, like Newton's or Maxwell's or Spinoza's, stand on their own. Intuition, the deepest kind of knowledge, comes only occasionally, after long and hard work, and is a merging of the understander with the understood. His book elaborates on these ideas with examples from the theories of physics and philosophy, and the models of finance.\n\n\n== The Volatility Smile ==\nIn 2016, Derman and Michael Miller published a textbook titled The Volatility Smile, a textbook about the principles of financial modeling, option valuation, and the variety of models that can account for the volatility smile.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAll models are wrong\nFinancial engineering\nMathematical finance\nMathiness\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEmanuel Derman: Writings on Quantitative Finance \u2013 Personal website\nHis profile at Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University\nDerman's Blog (earlier Blogs on wilmott.com)\nEmanuel Derman at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\nRoberts, Russ (March 12, 2012). \"Derman on Theories, Models, and Science\".

Good has received 21 Juno Award nominations during his career, winning four.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nGood's introduction into the music scene began when he was asked by members of a folk group to write lyrics for them while he was in high school. Good then began singing with the group. Good taught himself to play guitar at the age of 20 and continued to write songs. Good's early career in music involved a variety of folk demos and a stint as the lead singer of a folk band, The Rodchester Kings. Matthew Good and guitarist Simon Woodcock were discovered at an open mic at Simon Fraser University by manager Brent Christensen. Early Rodchester Kings demos were recorded at Fragrant Time Records in Burnaby by Greg Wasmuth and Steven Codling.\nFrom 1992 to 1993, Good recorded short demo tapes called \"Left of Normal\", \"Broken\", and \"Euphony\", which featured the acoustic songs \"Mercy Misses You\", \"Heather's Like Sunday\", and the title track \"Euphony\". In 1994, he won a prize from 99.3 The Fox's Seeds competition, an annual competition of local Vancouver-based bands. The prize included recording time at a local studio/recording school, where, in September 1994, Good, along with band members Steve Codling, Judy Renouf, Eran Vooys, and Ariel Watson, recorded \"15 Hours on a September Thursday\". This demo tape included the songs \"Second Sun\", \"The Ocean\", and \"Last of the Ghetto Astronauts\". In December 1994, the band signed a publishing deal with EMI Publishing.\nIn March 1995, the original band went on tour across Canada. Upon return, the band split up and Matt started over with a new group of musicians.\n\n\n== Matthew Good Band ==\n\n\n=== Last of the Ghetto Astronauts (1995\u20131996) ===\nGood formed a three-piece rock band in 1995 composed of himself, drummer Ian Browne and bassist Geoff Lloyd. Dave Genn originally only recorded with the band as a paid session musician. The four recorded the band's debut album, Last of the Ghetto Astronauts. The band released the album independently in 1995, after which Genn officially joined the band. The band was not originally called \"Matthew Good Band\". In fact, the first 5000 copies of Last of the Ghetto Astronauts were just titled \"MGB\". After the album was released, \"Alabama Motel Room\" began to receive significant radio airplay, and people began requesting the song on radio and the album at retail stores calling the band, \"Matthew Good Band\". At the time, the band had been having conversations about the band's name, but the band then decided that the band would be called \"Matthew Good Band\". Although initially popular only in the Vancouver area, the band began to have more success across Canada in 1996, with the singles \"Alabama Motel Room\" and \"Symbolistic White Walls\" becoming significant hits on radio and their music videos being played on MuchMusic. In December 1996, Matthew Good Band signed a two-album deal with Private Music.\n\n\n=== Underdogs (1997\u20131999) ===\nIn mid-January 1997, on the first day of pre-production for their next album, the group was notified that BMG Entertainment North America was merging Private Music into Windham Hill/High Street Records, putting a halt to the production of the album. In mid-March, after negotiations, Windham Hill/High Street released the group from its contract. Good was paid what he was owed for the two albums, and the group then decided to record the new album regardless of label support, using the money received from the divorce of their contract with Windham Hill/High Street to fund it. The group then agreed to release the upcoming album under a distribution agreement with PolyGram Group Canada. After releasing the EP Raygun in May 1997, the band later that year released their second full-length album, Underdogs. The album was produced by Warne Livesey, who would go on to produce every full-length MGB album and most of Good's subsequent solo albums. The album spawned the singles \"Everything Is Automatic\", \"Indestructible\", \"Apparitions\" and \"Rico\", all which were hits in Canada. In November 1998, Geoff Lloyd left the band. Lloyd was replaced by Rich Priske shortly after. On January 21, 1999, Underdogs was certified Platinum in Canada.\n\n\n=== Beautiful Midnight (1999\u20132000) ===\nIn September 1999, the band released their next studio album, Beautiful Midnight. The album debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and featured the hit singles \"Hello Time Bomb\", \"Load Me Up\" and \"Strange Days\". In January 2000, Good underwent vocal cord surgery after being diagnosed with sarcoidosis, prompting him to temporarily quit smoking. In March 2000, The band won two Juno awards for \"Best Group\" and \"Best Rock Album\". Good himself did not attend the ceremony, and guitarist Dave Genn has been quoted as saying that he only attends for the open bar. Beautiful Midnight became the band's best-selling album, being certified Double Platinum in Canada and selling over 300,000 copies by 2016. In 2000, the band's song \"Running for Home\" was featured in an episode of Higher Ground.\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132001: The Audio of Being ===\nIn the summer of 2000, Good stayed in a hotel for three weeks in Whistler to work on songs for the new album. Good later wrote that he spent much of the time \"trying to keep down food supplement bars, trying to forget the growing tension within the band, the high expectations of needing to produce 'hit songs' (whatever they are these days), throwing up, and trying to find some semblance of direction in my personal life\". The band entered the studio in late 2000 to record the material. The sessions saw a great deal of intra-band turmoil. In February 2001, the band began a brief tour of the United States to promote the American release of Beautiful Midnight. In June 2001, the band released the EP Loser Anthems, and followed it with what would be the band's final tour in the summer. In August 2001, Dave Genn quit the band, returning though four days later. The band released The Audio of Being on October 30, 2001.\n\n\n=== Breakup ===\nIn November 2001, it was revealed that Genn had left the band again and Ian Browne had also left the band. In February 2002, Universal Music Canada confirmed that the band had broken up. In March 2002, during his first interview after the breakup was confirmed, Good stated that the breakup was \"a conscious effort on everybody's part\". In a 2009 interview for The Ongoing History of New Music, Good stated that he decided the band was done after The Audio of Being was released, citing him no longer wanting to placate the needs of the other band members and no one wanting to tour the record as reasons.\n\n\n== Solo career ==\n\n\n=== Avalanche (2003) ===\nGood released his solo debut, Avalanche, in 2003. The album featured major stylistic differences from those recorded with the previous band. The album featured the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra on several tracks, including the first two singles, \"Weapon\" and \"In a World Called Catastrophe\". Good recorded the album with long-time MGB producer Warne Livesey, who earned a Juno nomination for the effort.\nAt the 2003 Juno Awards, Good and co-director Ante Kovac won the Juno Award for Video of the Year for \"Weapon\".\n\n\n=== White Light Rock and Roll Review (2004) ===\nGood's second solo album, White Light Rock & Roll Review, was released on June 15, 2004. Singles included \"Alert Status Red\" and \"It's Been a While Since I Was Your Man\". For the album, Good elected to take a stripped-down approach. Rather than record each instrument separately, Good and his new band (which consisted of himself, former MGB bassist Rich Priske, guitarist Christian Thor Valdson and drummer Patrick Steward) recorded the songs as a unit, with Good adding vocals and additional guitar parts later. Good later noted that he loved the freedom of being able to write a song, enter the studio, and have a recording completed almost immediately, rather than having to deal with the sometimes arduous process of recording layers and layers of music for a single song.\nGood encountered controversy with the video for \"Alert Status Red\". Initially, the video was intended to be a concept piece, directed by Good. However, upon entering the editing stage, he realized he hadn't shot enough footage to make his concept work. He opted to turn all of the footage over to Kyle Davison, who directed the video for \"In a World Called Catastrophe\", to see if anything could be made out of it. Davison came up with his own concept, edited it together, and sent the finished product to Good. Good approved of the video, and made it available for download on his website. Good, however, was unaware that Davison had utilized several short clips of surveillance footage of the Columbine High School shootings in the piece. Upon hearing about the clips from individuals who felt the use was insensitive, Good pulled the video from his website. After watching it again, he decided to enlist the opinions of others, including MuchMusic, to see if they had any objections. Most felt it was reasonable, granted that the use wasn't exploitative and helped to support the message of the video, a message that they believed was decidedly relevant. Good agreed. He then returned the video to his website and expressed his support for the work of his co-director.\n\n\n=== In a Coma, solo acoustic tour (2005-2006) ===\nIn March 2005, Good brought in Ryan Dahle and Meegee Bradfield of Limblifter to join his band (replacing Valdson and Priske). Good noted that he was concerned his previous line-up had run its course creatively, and that, as a solo artist, he was graced with the freedom to change direction by involving different musicians. He hoped that Dahle and Bradfield might be able to lend a new perspective to familiar material. In April, the lineup entered the studio and recorded two tracks for the Matthew Good best-of, \"Big City Life\" and \"Oh Be Joyful\". However, when Good undertook a brief tour of Ontario in July 2005, he was rejoined by Priske and Valdson.\nA compilation of Good's work with the Matthew Good Band as well as his solo material was released in September 2005, titled In a Coma: Matthew Good 1995\u20132005. The first single from the album, \"Oh Be Joyful\", was released at the end of July.\nGood took particular care in the production of the expanded deluxe edition of In a Coma, which included an additional CD and a DVD. In April 2005, Good entered the studio and recorded nine songs from his catalog, reworked and performed acoustically. As a nod to fans who were unable to find them, the CD also included all of the tracks from the out-of-print EPs Lo-Fi B-Sides and Loser Anthems. The DVD featured the complete library of Good's music videos, including a new video for \"While We Were Hunting Rabbits\" from Avalanche developed by animation students at Sheridan College.\nFollowing the release of In a Coma, Good began demoing songs for a new album. While promoting In a Coma, Good noted that he might use the release of the compilation to mark the end of the first era of his career, where he could then move on to write \"weirder\" music. In December 2005, Good previewed a demo called \"Black Helicopter\", which he recorded at home using GarageBand on an Apple Power Mac G5.\nIn March 2006, Good embarked on a solo acoustic tour of Canada, which featured smaller crowds and more intimate settings. Good spent several weeks leading up to the tour reworking many of his older songs to fit a solo acoustic format, including rarities such as \"Fated\" and \"Life Beyond the Minimum Safe Distance\". He was joined on tour by opening act Melissa McClelland, with whom he played a cover of the Nine Inch Nails song \"Hurt\" at the end of his solo performances.\n\n\n=== Hospital Music, live album (2007-2008) ===\nIn the aftermath of divorcing his wife, developing an addiction to Ativan and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Good channeled the emotional turmoil into his next album, 2007's Hospital Music. The album was the first self-produced effort of his career and was written during his recovery from overdosing on Ativan and a stay in the psychiatric ward. Hospital Music included thinly veiled allusions to his divorce (\"I Am Not Safer Than a Bank\" and \"She's in It for the Money\") as well as darker subjects, such as Good's close friend Rod Bruno (who appears on guitar, bass and vocals throughout the record) losing his father to cancer (\"99% of Us Is Failure\"). The album also featured two cover songs, a radically reworked version of the Dead Kennedys' \"Moon Over Marin\" and Daniel Johnston's \"True Love Will Find You in the End\". The album's first single \"Born Losers\" was also a success, peaking at #27 on the Canadian Hot 100.\nHospital Music was additionally influenced by Good's proximity to Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, just blocks away from his Gastown loft. The opening sound bites in both \"Girl Wedged Under the Front of a Firebird\" and album-opener \"Champions of Nothing\" feature men narrating snippets of their experience from the impoverished neighbourhood.Hospital Music debuted at the top of the Canadian albums chart, Good's first number one album since Beautiful Midnight. The album also marked the end of his recording and publishing contracts.In support of Hospital Music, Good embarked on a brief solo tour of the United States in March 2008, and began a full-band tour of Canada in May.\nIn 2008, Good released Live at Massey Hall, the first live album of Matthew Good's career. Recorded at Toronto's landmark Massey Hall in May 2008, it is an unaltered recording of that night's performance.\n\n\n=== Vancouver (2009-2010) ===\nIn July 2008, Good announced he had begun working on his fourth solo album to be titled Vancouver. After entering the studio in early 2009 to record Vancouver, Good confirmed that he had re-signed with Universal Music Canada and the new album would not be an indie release. The album was released on October 6, 2009. For about a month prior to its release, the album was made available on his website for free streaming, stating a desire to make his music as accessible as possible. The first single released from the album was \"Last Parade.\"\nVancouver was a reflection of Good's experiences and opinions of his hometown. \"It's kind of like the way we were, the way we are \u2013 that kind of thing,\" Good has explained, referring to a sense of the city's \"depletion\", mostly in regards to the situation in the Downtown Eastside. The album also continued to explore Good's personal life, including his mental illness. He later described the recording of Hospital Music and Vancouver as having together \"closed chapters\" regarding his personal life, allowing him to focus his energy on a stylistically different project for his next album.A Canadian tour in support of Vancouver was announced in September 2009 and ran from October 3 to December 19. Joining Good and his band as a supporting act was fellow Vancouver-based group Mother Mother. The following year, Good toured the United States from March 8, 2010 to April 4, 2010.\nIn 2011, Vancouver won the \"Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year\", the second time Good has won the award.\n\n\n=== Lights of Endangered Species (2011) ===\nGood entered the studio on October 19, 2010, to record his fifth album as a solo artist, Lights of Endangered Species. He again worked with producer Warne Livesey, marking the sixth album Warne has produced with Good. Good and Warne's Facebook wall postings stated tracking was completed November 20, while mixing of the record was completed on December 11. The album was mastered in England during the first half of 2011 and was subsequently released on May 31. The track listing was released in the members section of matthewgood.org on January 13, 2011. The first single from the album, \"In a Place of Lesser Men\", was released on March 21 via SoundCloud. Good reunited with former MGB drummer Ian Browne during the tour of the album later in the year.\n\n\n=== Arrows of Desire, Chaotic Neutral (2013\u20132015) ===\nOn November 5, 2012, Matt announced via Facebook that he had entered the studio to begin recording his sixth solo studio album. The album's lead single, \"Had It Coming\", was released on May 28, 2013. The album, Arrows of Desire, was released on September 24, 2013. The album's audio was released to be streamed in Canada and Europe, as a promotion leading up to the album's release (September 17\u201324).On July 17, 2015, Good released the song \"All You Sons and Daughters\", the first single from his seventh solo studio album, Chaotic Neutral. The album was released on September 25, 2015.\n\n\n=== I Miss New Wave: Beautiful Midnight Revisited (2016) ===\nIn November 2016, Good announced on his website that he had been in the studio to re-record 5 tracks from the 1999 Matthew Good Band album, Beautiful Midnight.  The five re-recorded Beautiful Midnight tracks on the EP are \"I Miss New Wave\", \"Suburbia\", \"Born to Kill\", \"Let's Get It On\" and \"Load Me Up\". The EP, titled I Miss New Wave: Beautiful Midnight Revisited,  was released on December 2, 2016. The EP was promoted in a tour during February and March 2017 in which Good performed the Beautiful Midnight album in its entirety.\n\n\n=== Something Like a Storm, Moving Walls (2017\u2013present) ===\nOn April 21, 2017, Good released a new song, titled \"Bad Guys Win\", from his upcoming album.  A music video for the song was simultaneously released. On July 14, Good released the lead single from the album, \"Decades\", which was also accompanied by a music video. In September 2017, the album was announced as being titled Something Like a Storm. The album was released on October 20, 2017.Good embarked on a co-headline tour across Canada with Our Lady Peace in March, 2018. On March 27, during a performance in Edmonton, Good collapsed onstage due to pneumonia and was taken to a hospital. Good's performance for the next show on the tour was cancelled, but Good returned to the tour on March 30.\n\nIn 2019, Good embarked on his first solo acoustic tour since 2007. On October 18, 2019, Good released a new single, titled \"Sicily\". An accompanying music video was released on November 21, 2019. \"Sicily\" is taken from the forthcoming 15-track new album, Moving Walls, that was released in February 2020.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nApart from his music career, Good has also been a writer and blogger. From late 1997 through the end of 2000, Good published a series of monthly \"manifestos\" on the band's website. Many of those were later compiled and released in his debut book At Last There Is Nothing Left To Say, published in 2001 by Insomniac Press (ISBN 1-894663-08-X).\nThroughout his life, Good has found a passion for politics and history. He once commented that he would have become a history teacher had he not found success as a musician. In recent years, he has made his political views far more public, and has used his website to express his opinions about the Canadian government, the effects of the United States' foreign policy, and world crises like the conflict in Darfur, Sudan. Good has also been heavily involved with Amnesty International, bringing Amnesty representatives on the road with him during his 2004 tour and offering a limited-edition soccer jersey on his website with proceeds going to Amnesty.\nIn 2008, Good created a new website entitled Dear San Diego, on which he writes fictional journal entries. In an interview, Good said regarding his writing: \"It comes from the need inside of me to make fun of people. And my need to make fun of myself.\nI like writing things that are both intelligent and subversive. There's so much for me to write about \u2013 society has become so absolutely ridiculous.\"Good's blogs are 'tweeted' to over 5,000 followers. Until recently Good made a practice of return following all Twitter followers but recently has found that reading so much content from these followers has left him with no other option but to unfollow all but a few.While Good has been credited with coining the phrase first world problems, it is actually an inaccuracy, as G.K. Payne used the phrase in a book in the late 1970s.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGood, whose family background is English, was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, and grew up in Coquitlam \u2013 both suburbs of Vancouver. After living in various parts of Vancouver for the majority of his career, Good moved to Maple Ridge around the time of Vancouver's 2009 release.Good has been affected by ongoing bouts of mania and anxiety throughout his career, many of which he credited to the stresses of popularity. He recalls regularly passing out and vomiting during the time of The Audio of Being's recording in 2001. Behind the scenes of Good's 2005 release of In a Coma and his subsequent touring, Good's ongoing mental health concerns escalated, particularly following the unexpected separation from his first wife, Jennifer, in February 2006. In early 2006, prior to a solo acoustic tour of Canada, Good was prescribed Ativan to help counter his anxiety. During a stop in Kingston, Ontario, Good was rushed to the hospital following an adverse reaction to the Ativan. The last two shows of the tour were cancelled for what Good later explained was a \"nervous breakdown\".The following summer, Good planned to spend several months in Europe to write a book. However, just a few days into the trip, Good found himself overwhelmed emotionally, experiencing what he described as the \"absolute worst manic episode\" while visiting friends in Bristol. He returned to Vancouver, moving into his parents' home. While there, Good began to have an increasing dependence on Ativan. One night, while at his parents' house, Good took upwards of 45 Ativan pills and collapsed to the floor. The collapse was heard by his parents and he was rushed to the hospital. During a brief stay in the hospital's psychiatric ward, to which he willfully committed himself, Good was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The genetic illness was traced back to his mother's side. Recalling past events and stages throughout his life, he has described the diagnosis as a relief, adding \"it was like finding the final pieces of the puzzle.\" Good wrote much of the material for his 2007 release, Hospital Music during his recovery.In September 2013 Good took to the stage at Toronto's TEDx conference to speak about his creative life and his bi-polar diagnosis.\nGood was a cousin in-law of Talk Talk lead singer Mark Hollis, who Good also claims as one of his biggest musical influences.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== with Matthew Good Band ===\n\nLast of the Ghetto Astronauts (1995)\nRaygun (1997)\nUnderdogs (1997)\nLo-Fi B-Sides (1998)\nBeautiful Midnight (1999)\nLoser Anthems: B-Sides & Rarities (2001)\nThe Audio of Being (2001)\n\n\n=== Solo ===\n\nAvalanche (2003)\nWhite Light Rock & Roll Review (2004)\n In a Coma: 1995\u20132005 (2005)\nHospital Music (2007)\nLive at Massey Hall (2008)\nVancouver (2009)\nLights of Endangered Species (2011)\nOld Fighters (2013)\nArrows of Desire (2013)\nChaotic Neutral (2015)\nI Miss New Wave: Beautiful Midnight Revisited (2016)\nSomething Like a Storm (2017)\nMoving Walls (2020)\n\n\n== Juno Awards ==\nRock Album of the Year, Vancouver, 2011 Juno Awards (Solo career)\nVideo of the Year, Weapon, 2003 Juno Awards (Solo career)\nBest Rock Album of the Year, Beautiful Midnight, 2000 Juno Awards (with Matthew Good Band)\nBest Group of the Year, Matthew Good Band, 2000 Juno Awards (with Matthew Good Band)Good did not attend any of the ceremonies where he won awards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMusic of Canada\nList of Canadian musicians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGood, Matthew (2001).

In January 1759, his mother married George Washington. The Washingtons raised him and his younger sister Martha (Patsy) Parke Custis (1756\u20131773) at Mount Vernon. Washington became his legal guardian, and administrator of the Custis Estate. Upon his sister's death in 1773 at the age of seventeen, Custis became the sole heir of the Custis estate.\nJacky was a troubled, lazy and \"free-willed\" child, who took no interest in his studies.\n\n\n== Family and works ==\nIn 1773, at the age of eighteen, \"Jacky\", as he was known by his family, announced to the Washingtons his engagement to Eleanor Calvert, a daughter of Benedict Swingate Calvert and granddaughter of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.  George and Martha were greatly surprised by the marriage choice due to the couple being so young. During that year, Custis began to attend King's College (later Columbia University) in New York City, but left soon afterwards when his sister died.On February 3, 1774, Custis married Eleanor at her family's home at the Mount Airy estate. Its restored mansion is the center of Rosaryville State Park in Prince George's County, Maryland. After their marriage, the couple settled at the White House plantation.  After the couple had lived at the White House for more than two years, Custis purchased the Abingdon plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia (now in Arlington County, Virginia). The couple settled there during the winter of 1778\u20131779.The terms of Abingdon's purchase were extremely unfavorable to Custis. His eagerness and inexperience allowed Abingdon's owner, Robert Alexander, to take advantage of him in the transaction, which required Custis to pay the principal of the purchase and compound interest over a 24-year period. The compound interest on the \u00a312,000 purchase price would require Custis to pay over \u00a348,000 during the 24 years. To accomplish this, Custis would need to pay over \u00a32,000 each year during the period of the agreement. When he learned of the terms of the purchase, George Washington informed Custis that \"No Virginia Estate (except a few under the best management) can stand simple Interest how then can they bear compound Interest\".Custis' behavior in this and other matters prompted George Washington to write in 1778: \"I am afraid Jack Custis, in spite of all of the admonition and advice I gave him about selling faster than he bought, is making a ruinous hand of his Estate.\"  By 1781, the financial strains of the Abingdon purchase had almost bankrupted Custis.According to one account, Custis served on Washington's staff during the Siege of Boston in 1775\u20131776 and served as an emissary to the British forces there.In 1778, Custis was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses as a delegate from Fairfax County.\nGeorge Washington was not pleased with Custis' reported performance in the legislature. Washington wrote to Custis:\n\nI do not suppose that so young a senator as you are, so little versed in political disquisition, can yet have much influence in a popular assembly, composed of various talents and different views, but it is in your power to be punctual in attendance.\nJohn and Eleanor had seven children:\n\nunnamed daughter (1775 - 1775), died shortly after birth\nElizabeth (Eliza) Parke Custis (1776\u20131831), married Thomas Law, an English immigrant\nMartha (Patsy) Parke Custis (1777\u20131854), married Thomas Peter\nEleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis (1779\u20131852) (born at Abingdon), married Lawrence Lewis\nunnamed twin daughters (1780 - 1780), died three weeks after birth\nGeorge Washington (Wash) Parke Custis (1781\u20131857) (born at Mount Airy), married Mary Lee Fitzhugh.\n\n\n== Death ==\nCustis served as a civilian aide-de-camp to Washington during the siege of Yorktown. However, Custis contracted \"camp fever\", which could have been an illness now described as epidemic typhus, or dysentery  while at Yorktown. Shortly after the surrender of Cornwallis, Custis died on November 5, 1781, in New Kent County at Eltham, Virginia, in the home of Colonel and Mrs. Burwell Bassett, brother-in-law and sister of Martha Washington. He was buried at his family's plot near Queen's Creek in York County, near Williamsburg, Virginia.With Custis's premature death at age 26, his widow sent her two youngest children (Eleanor and George) to Mount Vernon to be raised by the Washingtons. In 1783, she married Dr. David Stuart of Alexandria, Virginia, with whom she had 16 more children.Although Custis had become well-established at Abingdon, his financial matters were in a state of disarray due to his poor business judgement and wartime taxation. After his death in 1781, it took the administrators of the Custis Estate more than a decade to negotiate an end to the transaction through which Custis had purchased Abingdon. Because he died intestate, his estate was not fully liquidated until the 1811 death of his  widow; his four children inherited more than 600 slaves.Part of the Abingdon estate is now on the grounds of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. At the time that he purchased Abingdon, Custis also bought a nearby property that after his death became the Arlington Plantation and later, Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nGrizzard, Frank E., Jr. (2002).

She also served in a dual capacity as the chief operating officer of the State of Colorado. She was appointed to the position by Colorado governor John Hickenlooper on March 23, 2016 and was confirmed by the Colorado House of Representatives and the state Senate on May 4, 2016. Lynne replaced the outgoing lieutenant governor, Joseph A. Garcia. Prior to her appointment, Lynne was an executive with Kaiser Permanente.In September 2017, Lynne announced she was running for governor in the 2018 election. However, she lost the Democratic primary on June 26, 2018 to Jared Polis.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLynne was born on a Navy base in Jacksonville, Florida. Her father at the time of her birth was in the military for 20 years. Both of her parents were World War II veterans. Lynne is a graduate of the University of New Hampshire, where she received a B. A. in economics and political science. She also attended George Washington University, where she received a Master of Public Administration and obtained a Doctor of Public Health degree from Columbia University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLynne spent 20 years working in New York City government. During that time she served as first deputy commissioner for the office of labor relations, director for the mayor's office of operations, and senior vice president for the New York City health and hospital corps.After leaving New York City government, Lynne went on to work for Group Health Incorporated (GHI) as the executive vice president before being promoted to president of GHI HMO, a subsidiary of GHI. After leaving GHI, Lynne became the president of Kaiser Permanente for the Colorado Region. Within Kaiser, Lynne also served as executive vice president of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc and as a group president for Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and  Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. In her role as group president, she oversaw the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii regions.  During her time at Kaiser, Lynne was selected by the Denver Business Journal as one of the city's \"Outstanding Women in Business\" in 2008, and as one of the Top 25 Women in Healthcare by Modern Healthcare magazine in 2015.

Lynne co-chaired the Colorado Space Coalition, the Early Childhood Leadership Commission, the Governor's Commission on Community Service, and the Colorado Commission on Indian Affairs. The lieutenant governor's office also provides oversight for the office of eHealth Innovation and the Colorado State Innovation Model. At the beginning of her term, Lynne filled in as the interim director of the Colorado Department of Higher Education until Diane Duffy was appointed to the position in October 2016.Due to her background, one of Lynne's major focuses throughout her term had been on state and federal health care reform. In a guest commentary article in The Denver Post in May 2017, Lynne expressed her dismay with the recently proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA), stating that the republican-sponsored bill would have a damaging impact on all of Colorado, but specifically its rural communities, by cutting critical funding to the state's Medicaid program. Lynne also wrote about the need to preserve Colorado's outdoor recreation spots in a separate Denver Post article written in the beginning of 2017, highlighting the fact that many of Colorado's beloved outdoor landmarks\u2014like the state's rivers, hiking and biking trails, campgrounds, and fourteeners\u2014are in desperate need of improvements. In the article, Lynne expressed that this issue is of particular importance to her because outdoor recreation is one of the major drivers of the Colorado economy, and because she has personally summited all of Colorado's mountains that are over 14,000 feet tall.\n\n\n=== Chief operating officer ===\nAs chief operating officer for the state of Colorado, Lynne launched the Governor's Dashboard, an online tool that allows viewers to see a snapshot of state progress with regards to five major priorities that are vital to fulfilling the vision of a Healthy Colorado. Lynne also manages quarterly performance reviews across cabinet departments, helped to launch customer feedback surveys for high-volume state services, and uses information garnered from those surveys to assess the quality of statewide services.  In the spring of 2017, Lynne also participated in and oversaw the fourth successful Performance Academy, a program that trains state leaders in how to better serve Coloradans. In April 2017, Lynne concluded a tour of all 64 counties of Colorado where she engaged directly with many community leaders.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of female lieutenant governors in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website of the Lieutenant Governor of Colorado\nOfficial Campaign website for Governor of Colorado", "label": 1}

Martin was the first person to read the completed manuscript of Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, claiming she told Atwood that the book would make her rich. Atwood returned the favor and read some of Martin's then-unpublished works, and liked them enough to send them to editor and publisher Nan A. Talese, who has remained Martin's editor ever since.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nMartin's fictional works include Set in Motion (1978), Alexandra (1979), A Recent Martyr (1987), The Consolation of Nature and Other Stories (1988), The Great Divorce (1993), Italian Fever (1999), The Unfinished Novel and Other Stories (2006), Trespass (2007), and The Confessions of Edward Day (2009).

She is the surviving third wife of producer/director Stanley Kramer, to whom she was married from 1966 until his death in 2001. She has since been the caretaker of the Kramer estate and legacy.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nKaren Kay Sharpe was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1934.  According to the federal census of 1940, her parents, Howard and Dorothy Sharp (spelled with no \"e\") were both natives of Indiana.  That census also documents that in 1940, the family continued to reside in San Antonio and her father worked then as a sales manager for a local electric company.As a child, Karen studied ballet and dancing. Her desire to be an actress led her to California, where she hoped \"to be discovered on a drug store stool, like Lana Turner ...\". In Los Angeles, Sharpe studied dancing with Adolph Bolm.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nWhile acting in plays, Sharpe was discovered by a talent scout from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. Her screen test at MGM was unsuccessful, as were later screen tests with Columbia and Universal. She worked as a model, posing for magazine covers and doing commercials.\n\n\n== Film ==\nIn 1952, at the age of 18, Sharpe appeared in Stanley Kramer's production of The Sniper, directed by Edward Dmytryk.  She spoke three lines in the film while sitting on a drugstore stool and did not personally meet Kramer at that time. That same year, she was cast uncredited as the younger sister of Janice Rule in the film Holiday for Sinners, opposite William Campbell. In 1953, she appeared as Lucy Colfax in the John Payne-Jan Sterling film, The Vanquished.Director William A. Wellman cast Sharpe in the 1954 airline disaster film The High and the Mighty, which was distributed by Warner Bros.  In the film she portrays Nell Buck, a young bride who overcomes her fear of death through passion for her new husband, Milo, played by John Smith. Her performance in The High and the Mighty propelled Sharpe to the 1954 Golden Globe Award for \"New Star of the Year-Actress\". In 1955, she played Stella Atkins in the western film, Man with the Gun.\n\n\n== Television ==\nSharpe's initial venture into television was on The Angel and the Devil, a children's program produced by Hal Roach. She went on to work on other Roach productions while still in her teens.\nDuring the 1959-1960 television season, Sharpe was cast as Laura Thomas, the girlfriend of the title character, in 18 episodes of the CBS Western series Johnny Ringo, starring Don Durant as a fictitious gunfighter turned small-town sheriff. Johnny Ringo was the first series produced by Aaron Spelling. In 1961, she appeared in the episode \"Never Walk Alone\" of ABC's Western series Stagecoach West, performing in the role of Ruby Walker.  Her other ABC appearances were on 77 Sunset Strip (twice), Hawaiian Eye, Burke's Law, The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse, and The Dakotas.Later in 1961, seven years after The High and the Mighty, Sharpe was reunited with John Smith in his NBC Western series, Laramie. She portrayed Madge Barrington, the daughter of  Colonel John Barrington, played by George Macready, whose character was presumably modeled after John Chivington of the 1864 Sand Creek massacre in Colorado. In the storyline, Barrington escapes while facing a court martial at Fort Laramie for his subsequent role in the Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota in 1890. The episode reveals that Slim Sherman was present at Wounded Knee and testified against Barrington. Madge takes Slim hostage and presents papers that she contends justify her father's harsh policies against the Indians. Slim manages to escape, but is trapped by the Sioux and must negotiate with the Indians to escape massacre.Sharpe appeared in many other television series in the 1950s and early 1960s, including CBS's Racket Squad, Lux Video Theatre, Playhouse 90, General Electric Theater, The West Point Story, The Millionaire (in the lead role in \"The Anitra Dellano Story\"), Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Perry Mason (the title character in the 1958 episode \"The Case of the Hesitant Hostess\"), The Smothers Brothers Show, and Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\nShe appeared twice on the CBS Western Rawhide, in that series' 1962 episode \"Gold Fever\" and in its 1963 episode \"Incident of the Black Ace\".  She also guest-starred on several other CBS Westerns:   Gunsmoke, in the episode \"Sweet and Sour\"; Trackdown, playing Edith Collins in \"The Young Gun\"; The Texan, as the character Jessie Martin in \"Private Account\"; and on Yancy Derringer, performing as Patricia Lee in \"Game of Chance\".  In yet another television genre, she also guest-starred  on David Janssen's contemporary crime drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective in \"Echo of Laughter\", one of the last episodes of that series broadcast on CBS before it switched to NBC for its final year of production.Besides Laramie, Sharpe appeared on several other NBC series, including Fireside Theater, Cameo Theatre, Hallmark Hall of Fame, The Ford Television Theatre, Matinee Theater (seven times), The Loretta Young Show, Bonanza, Overland Trail, The Americans, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Sharpe appeared twice on NBC's I Dream of Jeannie.Sharpe was cast in several syndicated television series, too, including The Range Rider, Death Valley Days, and the American Civil War drama The Gray Ghost. She appeared on Studio 57, when it was broadcast in 1954 on the former DuMont Television Network. In 1955, she played the role of Clara Bryant Ford in the television film A Story About Henry Ford, based on the automobile mogul, who was portrayed by Arthur Franz. That same year, she played Martha Custis Washington in the television film The Courtship of George Washington and Martha Custis, with Marshall Thompson, nine years Sharpe's senior, cast as Washington.Sharpe's last roles on a regular series were in two episodes of The Wild Wild West. She appeared in Jerry Lewis's 1964 film The Disorderly Orderly, during which time she met Stanley Kramer, who was also directing Ship of Fools on the lot of Paramount Studios.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1957, Sharpe married actor Chester Marshall Jr. In 1961, Sharpe sued for divorce a second time, following an earlier suit and subsequent reconciliation. Marshall asked for alimony when their divorce case was heard in 1962. The divorce was granted on September 18, 1962, with Marshall's request for alimony having been dropped.Kramer and Sharpe married on September 1, 1966, in Beverly Hills, California. She later stopped acting to devote full time to her family, including the couple's two children, and to serve as assistant to her husband in the film industry.\n\n\n== Other ==\nWhen Sharpe's father died, she inherited his businesses \u2014 aluminum siding, air conditioning, and moving and storage operations \u2014 and left acting to run them. Four years later, in 1965, she sold the business for a profit and returned to acting.Sharpe maintains the Stanley Kramer Library. She established the Stanley Kramer Award at the Producer's Guild and the Stanley Kramer Fellowship Award in Directing through the University of California, Los Angeles. Both designations showcase and honor the works of socially conscious young filmmakers.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 1959, Modern Screen magazine gave Sharpe its Golden Key Award, designating her as \"one of the most promising young actresses in show business.\"\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKaren Sharpe on IMDb", "label": 0}

He is the only Republican member of Oregon's congressional delegation. Walden's district covers more than two-thirds of the state, generally east of the Cascades. He is the son of three-term Oregon State Representative Paul E. Walden. In October 2019, Walden announced that he would not run for reelection in 2020.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nWalden was born in The Dalles, Oregon, the son of Elizabeth (n\u00e9e McEwen) and Paul Ernest Walden. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Oregon in 1981. Before being elected to Congress, Walden owned and ran radio stations.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nWalden served as press secretary and chief of staff to Congressman Denny Smith from 1981 to 1987. He was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was appointed to the Oregon State Senate to fill a vacancy that opened up when Wes Cooley was elected to the U. S. House. Walden rose to the position of assistant majority leader in the Senate and was considering a bid for Oregon Governor in 1994. But upon discovering that the son he and his wife were expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for governor or seek reelection to the state senate. Their son died soon after birth.Walden was tapped as campaign manager for Cooley's reelection bid, but after Cooley was caught in several lies about his military service, Walden was one of many Republicans who called on Cooley to drop out of the race. Walden went as far as to announce he was running for the 2nd District seat as an independent. But he served as the Oregon chairman of Bob Dole's presidential campaign, and touted his \"strong Republican credentials\", implying that he would serve as a Republican if elected. Walden's candidacy led to fears that the Democrats could take advantage of a split in the Republican vote and take a seat they hadn't held since 1981. This ended when Cooley's predecessor, Bob Smith, was called out of retirement.Smith did not run for reelection in 1998. Walden easily won the Republican primary and the November general election. His district contains some liberal-leaning communities such as Ashland and his hometown, Hood River, but most of it leans heavily Republican, and Walden has been reelected ten times without serious difficulty, never receiving less than 60% of the vote except in 2018, when he received 56%. In 2002, he defeated Democrat Peter Buckley, who later became a member of the Oregon House of Representatives. In 2006, Walden defeated Democratic nominee Carol Voisin, and in 2008 he won a sixth term with 70% of the vote over Democrat Noah Lemas and Pacific Green Tristin Mock. After Senator Gordon Smith's defeat in the 2008 elections, Walden became the only Republican representing Oregon in Congress. \nOn October 28, 2019, Walden announced that he would not run for reelection. He disagreed with President Donald Trump over Trump's attempts to finance his border wall project and backed sanctioning Russia despite Trump's resistance. He voted to end the 35-day government shutdown and spoke up about the global warming crisis, but supported Trump in the Ukraine quid pro quo scandal.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Party leadership ===\nHouse Speaker John Boehner chose Walden to be chairman of the House Majority Transition Committee. He served as chairman of the House Republican leadership through most of 2010.After the 2012 elections, Walden became chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. In July 2014, he announced he would seek a second term as chair, arguing he would help provide continuity in a changing leadership team after the defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. He served a second term, the traditional limit for holders of the office, ending in 2016.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\nSubcommittee on Communications and Technology (Chairman)\nSubcommittee on Energy and PowerFrom 2010 to 2011, Walden gave up his seat on the Committee on Energy and Commerce at Republican leadership's request so that Parker Griffith, who had recently switched parties, could take his spot.Walden founded the Small Brewers Caucus and the Digital Television Caucus; as of 2007, he was a member of 39 congressional caucuses.\n\nWalden is also a member of the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership, the Congressional Cement Caucus and the Congressional Western Caucus.\n\n\n=== Legislation sponsored ===\nThe following is an incomplete list of legislation Walden has introduced into the House of Representatives.\n\nCentral Oregon Jobs and Water Security Act (H.R. 2640; 113th Congress), a land-use and water bill related to the Crooked River in Oregon and the Bowman Dam. H.R. 2640 would modify features of the Crooked River Project in central Oregon, near Prineville, and prioritize how water from the project is allocated.\nFederal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rule-making processes. The FCC would have to act in more transparently and accept public input on regulations. Walden said the bill was written in response, among other things, to a proposed FCC study on the newspaper editorial boards' decisions. Walden argued that \"Americans deserve greater... transparency and accountability from their government,\" particularly because \"an item as controversial as this study made it all the way through the FCC without so much as a commission vote.\" He called the study dangerous because it threatened the papers' free speech and freedom of the press rights.\nHermiston Reversionary Interest Release Act (H.R. 3366; 113th Congress), a bill that would release the interest of the United States in some land being used for Oregon State University's Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Hermiston, Oregon. This would enable the center to relocate without its land being returned to the federal government. The Bureau of Land Management opposed the bill and it died in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in December 2014.\nSTELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4572; 113th Congress), a bill related to the regulation of satellite broadcasting.\n\n\n=== Intervention in Malheur Wildlife Refuge issues ===\nWalden, whose district office includes the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, said that although one militant was killed and another wounded in the armed occupation of the refuge, \"We can all be grateful that today has ended peacefully, and that this situation is finally over. Now, life in Harney County can begin to return to normal and the community can begin the long process of healing.\" He complained about allegedly poor federal forest and land management policies during the occupation, and said he would like to see changes to those policies: \"We need to foster a more cooperative spirit between the federal agencies and the people who call areas like Harney County home.\" On June 27, 2018, Walden pleaded for a pardon for Dwight and Steven Hammond, who repeatedly committed arson and threatened federal refuge workers over an 18-year period, saying that the original trial's federal judge, Michael Robert Hogan, said that the mandatory sentence would \"shock the conscious [sic]\". On July 10, Trump pardoned both men, commuting their sentences to time served. Steven had been scheduled to be released on June 29, 2019, and Dwight on February 13, 2020.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nWalden and his wife, Mylene, live in Hood River with their son Anthony. They are members of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and participate in local civic groups such as the Rotary Club and the Chamber of Commerce.Walden was a licensed amateur (ham) radio operator, W7EQI.\n\n\n=== Business interests ===\nOn January 31, 2007, Walden sold Columbia Gorge Broadcasting, which runs five stations in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, to Bicoastal Columbia River LLC in order to avoid any conflict of interest that might arise with his congressional duties.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Greg Walden official U.S. House website\nGreg Walden for Congress\nGreg Walden at Curlie\nAppearances on C-SPANBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nGreg Walden at The Oregonian", "label": 0}

We will explore the origin of inanimate physical structures (the origin of cosmos as a whole, as well as that of galaxies, stars, planets, particles, atoms and complex molecules), the origin of life (the origin of replicating molecules, the first cells, as well as more complex life forms), the origin of mind (the origin of self-reflective conscious awareness) and the origin of culture (the origins of language, myth, religion, art and science). We will consider the adaptive role of these developments and then consider what science in particular tells us about the far future of matter and mind. Throughout, we will examine the long-standing human search for meaning.\n", "wiki_title": "Brian Greene", "wiki_page": "Brian Randolph Greene (born February 9, 1963) is an American theoretical physicist, mathematician, and string theorist. He has been a professor at Columbia University since 1996 and chairman of the World Science Festival since co-founding it in 2008.  Greene has worked on mirror symmetry, relating two different Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds (concretely, relating the conifold to one of its orbifolds).  He also described the flop transition, a mild form of topology change, showing that topology in string theory can change at the conifold point.\nGreene has become known to a wider audience through his books for the general public, The Elegant Universe, Icarus at the Edge of Time, The Fabric of the Cosmos, The Hidden Reality,  and related PBS television specials. He also appeared on The Big Bang Theory episode \"The Herb Garden Germination\", as well as the films Frequency and The Last Mimzy. He is currently a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Greene was also the narrator for the U.S. version of the preschool television series, Maisy.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGreene was born in New York City of Jewish background. His father, Alan Greene, was a one-time vaudeville performer and high school dropout who later worked as a voice coach and composer. After attending Stuyvesant High School, Greene entered Harvard University in 1980 to concentrate in physics. After completing his bachelor's degree with summa cum laude honors, Greene earned his doctorate at Magdalen College, Oxford University, graduating in 1987. While at Oxford, Greene also studied piano with the concert pianist Jack Gibbons.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGreene joined the physics faculty of Cornell University in 1990 and was appointed to a full professorship in 1995. The following year, he joined the staff of Columbia University as a full professor. At Columbia, Greene is co-director of the university's Institute for Strings, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics (ISCAP) and is leading a research program applying superstring theory to cosmological questions. With co-investigators David Albert and Maulik Parikh he is a FQXi large-grant awardee for his project entitled \"Arrow of Time in the Quantum Universe\".\n\n\n=== Research ===\nGreene's area of research is string theory, a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity.  He is known for his contribution to the understanding of the different shapes the curled-up dimensions of string theory can take. The most important of these shapes are so-called Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds; when the extra dimensions take on those particular forms, physics in three dimensions exhibits an abstract symmetry known as supersymmetry.Greene has worked on a particular class of symmetry relating two different Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds, known as  mirror symmetry and is known for his research on the flop transition, a mild form of topology change, showing that topology in string theory can change at the conifold point.Currently, Greene studies string cosmology, especially the imprints of trans Planckian physics on the cosmic microwave background, and brane-gas cosmologies that could explain why the space around us has three large dimensions, expanding on the suggestion of a black hole electron, namely that the electron may be a black hole.\n\n\n=== World Science Festival ===\nIn 2008, together with Tracy Day (former ABC News producer), Greene co-founded the World Science Festival, whose mission is to cultivate a general public informed by science, inspired by  wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future.The World Science Festival's signature event is a five-day festival in New York City, typically falling in May. Held at a variety of museums, galleries, and outdoor venues, the festival has surpassed 2 million attendees. Hailed as a \u201cnew cultural institution\u201d, by The New York Times, the Festival has featured such luminaries as: Stephen Hawking, Edward O. Wilson, Sir Paul Nurse, James Watson, Anna Deavere Smith, Francis Collins, Philip Glass, Yo-Yo Ma, Oliver Sacks, Mary-Claire King, William Phillips, Paul Davies, Elizabeth Vargas, Sir Roger Penrose, Charlie Rose, Lisa P. Jackson, John Lithgow, Vinton Cerf, Glenn Close, Jeffrey Eugenides, Bill T. Jones, Joyce Carol Oates, Elaine Fuchs.\n\n\n=== Communicating science ===\n\nGreene is well known to a wider audience for his work on popularizing theoretical physics, in particular string theory and the search for a unified theory of physics. His first book, The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory, published in 1999, is a popularization of superstring theory and M-theory. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, and winner of The Aventis Prizes for Science Books in 2000. The Elegant Universe was later made into a PBS television special of the same name, hosted and narrated by Greene, which won a 2003 Peabody Award.Greene's second book, The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality (2004), is about space, time, and the nature of the universe. Aspects covered in this book include non-local particle entanglement as it relates to special relativity and basic explanations of string theory. It is an examination of the very nature of matter and reality, covering such topics as spacetime and cosmology, origins and unification, and including an exploration into reality and the imagination.  The Fabric of the Cosmos was later made into a PBS television special of the same name, hosted and narrated by Greene.Greene's third book, The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos, published in January 2011, deals in greater depth with multiple universes, or, as they are sometimes referred to collectively, the multiverse.A book for a younger audience, Icarus at the Edge of Time, which is a futuristic re-telling of the Icarus myth, was published September 2, 2008. In addition to authoring popular-science books, Greene is an occasional Op-Ed Contributor for The New York Times, writing on his work and other scientific topics.The popularity of his books and his natural on-camera demeanor have resulted in many media appearances, including Charlie Rose, The Colbert Report, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, The Century with Peter Jennings, CNN, TIME, Nightline in Primetime, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and the Late Show with David Letterman. It has also led to Greene helping John Lithgow with scientific dialogue for the television series 3rd Rock from the Sun, and becoming a technical consultant for the film Frequency, in which he also had a cameo role. He was a consultant on the 2006 time-travel movie D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu.  He also had a cameo appearance as an Intel scientist in 2007's The Last Mimzy.  Greene was also mentioned in the 2002 Angel episode \"Supersymmetry\" and in the 2008 Stargate Atlantis episode \"Trio\". In April 2011 he appeared on The Big Bang Theory in the episode \"The Herb Garden Germination\" as himself, speaking to a small crowd about the contents of his most recent book.Greene often lectures outside of the collegiate setting, at both a general and a technical level, in more than twenty-five countries. In 2012 his teaching prowess was recognized when he received the Richtmyer Memorial Award, which is given annually by the American Association of Physics Teachers.In May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress.  Brian Greene was listed by one commentator as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.In March 2015, an Australian spider that uses waves to hunt prey, Dolomedes briangreenei, was to be named in honor of Brian Greene.He was interviewed at length by Jim Al-Khalili on the BBC radio program The Life Scientific on 28 April 2020.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGreene is married to former ABC producer Tracy Day. They have one son, Alec,  and one daughter, Sophia. \nGreene has been vegetarian since he was nine years old and a vegan since 1997.Greene has stated that he sees science as incompatible with literalist interpretations of religion and that there is much in the New Atheism movement which resonates with him because he personally does not feel the need for religious explanation. However, he is uncertain of its efficacy as a strategy for spreading a scientific worldview. In an interview with the Guardian he says  \"When I\u2019m looking to understand myself as a human, and how I fit in to the long chain of human culture that reaches back thousands of years, religion is a deeply valuable part of that story.\" \n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Popular science ===\nUntil the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe (2020)\nLight Falls: Space, Time, and an Obsession of Einstein (2016)\nThe Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos (2011)\nIcarus at the Edge of Time (2008)\nThe Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality (2004)\nThe Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory (1999)\n\n\n=== Technical articles ===\nFor a full list of technical articles, consult the publication list in the INSPIRE-HEP database\n\nEasther, Richard; Greene, Brian R.; Jackson, Mark G.; Kabat, Daniel (2005). \"String windings in the early universe\".

{"name": "Edward J Hoffman", "department": "School of Professional Studies (SPS) ", "course_descr": null, "wiki_title": "James Franco", "wiki_page": "James Edward Franco (born April 19, 1978) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, comedian, film producer, television producer, academic, painter and writer. For his role in 127 Hours (2010), he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. Franco is known for his roles in live-action films, such as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002\u20132007); Milk (2008); Pineapple Express (2008); Eat, Pray, Love (2010); Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011); Spring Breakers (2012); Oz the Great and Powerful (2013); This Is the End (2013); and The Disaster Artist (2017), for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. He is known for his collaborations with fellow actor Seth Rogen, having appeared in eight films and one television series with him.\nFranco is also known for his work on television; his first prominent acting role was the character Daniel Desario on the short-lived ensemble comedy-drama Freaks and Geeks (1999\u20132000), which developed a cult following. He portrayed the title character in the television biographical film James Dean (2001), for which he won a Golden Globe Award. Franco had a recurring role on the daytime soap opera General Hospital (2009\u20132012) and starred in the limited series 11.22.63 (2016). He starred in the David Simon-created HBO drama The Deuce (2017\u20132019).\nFranco volunteers for the Art of Elysium charity, and has taught film classes at New York University, the University of Southern California, UCLA, Studio 4, Palo Alto High School, and Playhouse West.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJames Edward Franco was born in Palo Alto, California on April 19, 1978. His mother, Betsy Lou (n\u00e9e Verne), is a children's book author and occasional actress, and his father, Douglas Eugene Franco, ran a Silicon Valley business. His father was of Portuguese (from Madeira) and Swedish ancestry, while his mother is Jewish, from a family of Russian-Jewish descent. His maternal grandfather, Daniel, changed his surname from \"Verovitz\" to \"Verne\" some time after 1940. His paternal grandmother, Marjorie (n\u00e9e Peterson), is a published author of young adult books. His maternal grandmother, Mitzie (n\u00e9e Levine), owned the prominent Verne Art Gallery in Cleveland, Ohio, and was an active member in the National Council of Jewish Women.Franco's family upbringing was \"academic, liberal, and largely secular\". He grew up in California with his two brothers, actors Tom and Dave. A \"math whiz\", Franco interned at Lockheed Martin. He was often encouraged by his father to get good grades and did well on his SATs. He graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996, where he acted in plays. This led to him attending CSSSA in 1998 for theater studies. In his high school years, Franco was arrested for underage drinking, graffiti, and being a part of a group that stole designer fragrances from department stores and sold them to classmates. These arrests led to Franco briefly becoming a ward of the state. Facing the possibility of juvenile hall, he was given a second chance by the judge. He recalled of his troubles with the law, \"It was teen angst. I was uncomfortable in my own skin. I was shy. I changed my ways just in time to get good grades.\"Although the idea of becoming a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year (against his parents' wishes) to pursue a career as an actor, since he would have had to wait two years to audition for their acting program. He instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, he took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian for the year prior to working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial titled \"McDonald's was there for me when no one else was\".\n\n\n== Acting career ==\n\n\n=== 1997\u20132001 ===\nAfter 15 months of training, Franco began auditioning in Los Angeles. His first paid role was a television commercial for Pizza Hut, featuring a dancing Elvis Presley (who had died in 1977). He found guest roles on television shows but his first break came in 1999, after he was cast in a leading role on the short-lived but well-reviewed NBC television series Freaks and Geeks, which ran for 18 episodes and was canceled due to low viewership. Later, the show became a cult hit among audiences. He has since described the series as \"one of the most fun\" work experiences that he has had. In another interview, Franco said: \"When we were doing Freaks and Geeks, I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me ... So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.\" After his film debut Never Been Kissed, he played a popular jock Chris in Whatever It Takes (2000), a modern-day remake of the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac.He was subsequently cast as the title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean. To immerse himself in the role, Franco went from being a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his dark brown hair blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos. To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies. While filming James Dean, the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. \"It was a very lonely existence,\" he notes. \"If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean.\" Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man.\" He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).\n\n\n=== 2002\u20132007 ===\nFranco achieved worldwide fame and attention in the 2002 superhero film Spider-Man, when he played Harry Osborn, the son of the villainous Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and best friend of Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire). Originally, Franco was considered for the lead role of Spider-Man/Peter Parker in the film. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that there are \"good moments\" between Maguire and Franco in the film. Spider-Man was a commercial and critical success. The movie grossed $114 million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $822 million worldwide.\n\nHe next starred in Sonny, a 2002 release in which he was directed by fellow actor Nicolas Cage, whose involvement had attracted Franco to the film. Set in 1980s New Orleans, Sonny follows the titular character (Franco) returning home after just being discharged from the Army. To prepare for his role, he met with sex workers or people who had previously been prostitutes. The movie was panned by critics, with the New York Post's Lou Lumenick calling it an \"instant candidate for worst movie of the year\". Franco was cast as a homeless drug addict in the drama City by the Sea (2002) after co-star Robert De Niro saw a snippet of his work in James Dean. He lived on the streets for several days to better understand the subject matter as well as talking to former or still-using drug addicts. He also co-starred with Neve Campbell in Robert Altman's ballet movie The Company (2003). The success of the first Spider-Man film led Franco to reprise the role in the 2004 sequel, Spider-Man 2. The movie was well received by critics, and it proved to be a big financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $783 million worldwide, it became the second highest-grossing film in 2004. The following year he made and starred in the black comedy The Ape and the 2005 war film The Great Raid, in which he portrayed Robert Prince, a captain in the United States Army's elite Sixth Ranger Battalion. In 2006, Franco co-starred with Tyrese Gibson in Annapolis and played legendary hero Tristan in Tristan & Isolde, a period piece dramatization of the Tristan and Iseult story also starring British actress Sophia Myles. For the former, he did eight months of boxing training and for the latter, he practiced horseback riding and sword fighting. He then completed training for his Private Pilot Licence in preparation for his role in Flyboys, which was released in September 2006; the same month, Franco appeared briefly in The Wicker Man, the remake of the seminal horror film. Also in 2006, he made a cameo appearance in the romantic comedy The Holiday.\n\nHe again played Harry Osborn in Spider-Man 3 (2007). In contrast to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 was met with a mixed reception by critics. Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891 million, it stands as the most successful film in the series, and Franco's highest-grossing film to date. In this same year, Franco made a cameo appearance as himself in the Apatow-directed comedy Knocked Up, which starred Freaks and Geeks alumni Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Martin Starr. Franco co-starred with Sienna Miller in the low-budget independent film Camille, a dark fantasy dramedy about a young newlywed couple and Interview, where he appears in a voice only role, both 2007 movies that were ignored by audiences and critics alike. Among his other 2007 projects were Good Time Max, which Franco wrote, directed and starred in. The movie premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and tells the story of two talented brothers who take very diverse paths in life, one going on to become a doctor whilst the other sibling (Franco) experiences unemployment and uses drugs. The actor chose to cast himself in that role because, \"It was really just a process of elimination. I was better suited for this role than the responsible surgeon\".\n\n\n=== 2008\u20132010 ===\nHe next starred in Pineapple Express (2008), a stoner comedy co-starring and co-written by Seth Rogen and produced by Judd Apatow. Of Franco's character, Apatow said, \"You tell him, 'Okay, you're going to play a pot dealer', and he comes back with a three-dimensional character you totally believe exists. He takes it very seriously, even when it's comedy\". In her New York Times review, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: \"He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious\". His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. He has stated in some interviews that he no longer uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report). He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express. In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris. On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), and a second time on December 19, 2009.\n\nFranco starred with Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Emile Hirsch, in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008). In the film he plays Scott Smith, the boyfriend of Harvey Milk (Penn). Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, in review of the film, wrote: \"Franco is a nice match for him [Penn] as the lover who finally has enough of political life\". For his performance in the film, Franco won the Independent Spirit Award in the category for Best Supporting Actor. In late 2009 he joined the cast of the daytime soap opera General Hospital on a recurring basis. He plays Franco, a multimedia artist much like himself, who comes to Port Charles to do an art exhibition and becomes obsessed with Jason Morgan (Steve Burton). Franco has called his General Hospital role performance art.Franco began 2010 by making an appearance on the sitcom 30 Rock where he played himself and carried on a fake romance with Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) in a scheme concocted by their respective agents. After appearing in the commercial successes Date Night, an action comedy, and Eat Pray Love, an adaption of a novel, Franco played poet Allen Ginsberg in the drama Howl, released on September 24. The latter, about his most known poem and the trial about the work, premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and earned modest reviews.In his next project, 127 Hours, directed by Danny Boyle, Franco portrayed real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston. It was given a limited release starting on November 5, 2010. 127 Hours centered on Ralston trying to free his hand after it became trapped under a boulder in a ravine while canyoneering alone in Utah and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive, eventually amputating his arm. During the five-week, 12-hours-per-day shoot, Franco would only leave the gully set to use the lavatory and would read books such as academic textbooks to keep busy. Franco later called making 127 Hours a once-in-a-lifetime experience. To date, 127 Hours is one of his most well-reviewed movies and was also a commercial success, earning $60.7 million against an $18 million budget. His performance earned him universal acclaim from critics. Subsequently, he was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG award, as well as winning an Independent Spirit Award.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present ===\nOn February 23, 2011, Franco made a cameo appearance on NBC's Minute to Win It where the real-life Ralston was participating as a contestant playing for charity. After having an uncredited cameo in the opening scene of The Green Hornet (2011), he starred opposite Natalie Portman and Danny McBride in the Medieval fantasy comedy Your Highness. In the film, he plays Fabious, a prince who teams up with his brother (McBride) to rescue the soon to be bride of Fabious (played by Zooey Deschanel). In May 2010, he was cast to star in Rupert Wyatt's $93 million budgeted Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series which was released on August 5. Franco starred alongside Winona Ryder in The Letter, originally entitled The Stare, directed by Jay Anania. He was cast as a drug-addicted lawyer in About Cherry, also starring Heather Graham, which started shooting the following month in California. He dropped out of the indie film While We're Young to star in Oz the Great and Powerful, a Disney prequel to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). Filming began in July 2011, and the film was released on March 8, 2013. He has signed to do a sequel to it.At the end of September 2010, the actor acquired the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's desire to be a director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side. Franco also directed a film version of William Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying., the film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In late 2013, Franco starred in This Is the End as a fictionalized version of himself stuck in a house during an apocalypse with Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, also fictionalized versions of themselves.In February 2012, Franco began shooting a film version of Cormac McCarthy's 1973 novella Child of God, which stars Scott Haze as Lester Ballard. The film chronicles the depraved and violent impulses of the young Tennessee backwoodsman after he is dispossessed of his ancestral land. Child of God was selected in official competition at the 70th Venice Film Festival, an official selection to the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and an official selection to the prestigious 51st New York Film Festival. In 2013, Franco starred as the gangster \"Alien\" in Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers, with Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Gucci Mane and Rachel Korine. A24 films began a campaign in September 2013 in support of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for Franco's performance. In March 2013, it was announced that Franco was set to make his 2014 Broadway stage debut in the role of George in a revival of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. In October 2013, Franco appeared in the music video for \"City of Angels\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.On March 8, 2013, Franco received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6838 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nIn April 2014, Franco directed and appeared in \"Techno Color Sunglasses\", which promoted Gucci's eyewear collection. In December, Franco starred in the controversial Sony comedy thriller, The Interview, a film which played a central role in the real world diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea as they related to the 2014 Sony hacking incident. In April 2015, two of his projects, titled I Am Michael and True Story, were shown at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In I Am Michael, Franco plays a gay activist who rejects his homosexuality and becomes a conservative Christian pastor with a girlfriend. In True Story, based on a true story, Franco played Christian Longo, a man who was on the FBI's most wanted list for murdering his wife and three children in Oregon, and who had also been hiding under the identity of Michael Finkel, a journalist played by Jonah Hill.In 2015, Franco was cast in the lead role for the Hulu limited series 11.22.63 which is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. The eight-episode series premiered on February 15, 2016. In 2016, Franco co-produced and starred in King Cobra, a true story about the rise of gay pornographic actor Brent Corrigan and the murder of Bryan Kocis. Franco played Joseph Kerekes who (along with his partner) was convicted of the murder. In the comedy Why Him?, released in December 2016, Franco played an immature tech-billionaire whose girlfriend's conservative father tries to intervene in the couple's relationship, with Zoey Deutch playing the girlfriend and Bryan Cranston as her father. He briefly appeared in the Alien prequel, Alien: Covenant, alongside friend and frequent collaborator Danny McBride, and Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace. He played Branson, the captain of the Covenant ship and husband to Daniels, played by Katherine Waterston. The film was released on May 19, 2017.In 2016, Franco directed, co-produced, and starred in The Disaster Artist, the film adaptation of actor Greg Sestero's non-fiction book of the same name, about the making of The Room, which is considered to be one of worst films ever made. In the film, Franco portrayed the film's star, director, screenwriter, and producer Tommy Wiseau, while Franco's brother, Dave, portrayed Sestero. Franco remained in character as Wiseau throughout the entirety of the shoot. The Disaster Artist was released on December 1, 2017, to positive reviews, while his portrayal of Wiseau gained near-universal praise. His performance won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.At the end of 2017, Franco, almost 40, said he was slowing down to focus on himself.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nFranco produced and directed a documentary titled Saturday Night documenting a week in the production of an episode of SNL. The film began as a short for an NYU class but grew due to his two episodes as host, while short stories he wrote for other classes appeared in Esquire and McSweeney's. In summer 2010, the fictional Franco from General Hospital held an exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, while the real Franco held an exhibit at the museum based on his experiences on the soap opera.In 2008, Franco was named as the face of Gucci's men's fragrance line. His short films as director The Feast of Stephen and Herbert White were both presented within Maryland Film Festival in May 2010. Another of his short movies, The Clerk's Tale, was screened in competition at the Hamptons Film Festival at the end of 2010. In June 2010, James Franco presented his first solo exhibition, \"The Dangerous Book Four Boys\", presented at The Clocktower Gallery in New York City. Curated by Alanna Heiss, the show featured video, drawings, sculptures and installation.On October 19, 2010, Scribner published a collection of short stories, Palo Alto, by Franco. The book is named after the California city where Franco grew up and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories Palo Alto, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, consists of life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who spend most of their time indulging in driving drunk, smoking weed and taking part in unplanned acts of violence. Each passage is told by a young narrator. The book has received mixed reviews; Los Angeles Times called it \"the work of an ambitious young man who clearly loves to read, who has a good eye for detail, but who has spent way too much time on style and virtually none on substance\". The Guardian reported that Franco's \"foray into the literary world may be met with cynicism in some quarters, but this is a promising debut from a most unlikely source\". Writing in The New York Times, reviewer and fellow author Joshua Mohr praised Franco for how, in the story \"American History\", he juxtaposed historical parts with a present-day social commentary that \"makes the we wonder how much we've actually evolved in post-bellum America\". At least one editor of a literary journal testified he would not publish Franco's stories, claiming he has been published due to his star power, not literary talent. Publishers Weekly reviewed the collection, stating \"The author fails to find anything remotely insightful to say in these 11 amazingly underwhelming stories\".In January 2011, the actor screened his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, in which he merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him to turn it into something more. Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.\n\nOn February 27, 2011, he and Anne Hathaway hosted the 83rd Academy Awards. The two were selected to help the awards show achieve its goal of attracting a younger audience. Franco had previously said that he accepted the job for the experience and because it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Numerous media viewers criticized Franco for his discontent and lack of energy on stage and the show was widely panned, with some reviewers dubbing it the worst telecast in its history. The actor later spoke about his hosting in an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman. He explained that when accepting the job he never had high hopes, adding \"It was never on my list of things to do. It doesn't mean I didn't care and it doesn't mean I didn't try, right?\" Regarding allegations that he was under the influence of marijuana while hosting, Franco commented \"I think the Tasmanian Devil would look stoned standing next to Anne Hathaway. She has a lot of energy!\" He concluded that he tried his best and could have had \"low energy\" during the telecast.In May, Franco made his dance-theater directorial debut at New York's Stella Adler studios, where he narrated all the performances. Entitled \"Collage\" and described as a \"mixed-media piece\", the show featured live dance, theater, music, and poetry. Tickets were free but were distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. The actor also directed two short films for songs (\"Blue\" and \"That Someone Is You\") by R.E.M. from their album Collapse into Now (2011). Franco continued his career as a filmmaker with The Broken Tower, a 90-minute docudrama shot in black and white about poet Hart Crane, who committed suicide by jumping off the steamship SS Orizaba. It originally started out as his master's thesis. It was screened at 2011's Los Angeles Film Festival  \u2013  among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos from more than 30 countries. It was released on DVD in 2012.In 2011, Franco taught a graduate-level film course at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He has also taught film classes at USC and UCLA, as well as a screenwriting class on the online learning community Skillshare. For his students' film projects, Franco has helped to attract actors, including Seth MacFarlane, Kate Mara, Natalie Portman, Chloe Sevigny, Kristen Wiig and Olivia Wilde.Franco developed an aptitude for art\u2014painting in particular\u2014during his high school years while attending the California State Summer School for the Arts (CSSSA). Franco has said painting was the \"outlet\" he needed in high school, and he \"has actually been painting longer than he has been acting\". His paintings were displayed publicly for the first time at the Gl\u00fc Gallery in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006. He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin.In September 2012, Franco announced the release of his band Daddy's first single Love in the Old Days and their first EP MotorCity.  On July 9, 2013, Franco announced that he would be the featured roastee on the next Comedy Central Roast. The roast aired on September 2, 2013.In February 2014, Franco wrote an article in The New York Times in support of the metamodernist performance art of Shia LaBeouf, describing LaBeouf's project as one \"in which a young man in a very public profession tries to reclaim his public persona\". In April 2014, the literary publisher Graywolf Press issued Franco's first collection of poetry, Directing Herbert White. The title alludes to a poem (made by Franco into a 2010 short film) by Frank Bidart, who has served as friend and mentor to Franco.\n\n\n== In the media ==\nViewed as a sex symbol, Franco was named the Sexiest Man Living in 2009 by Salon.com. There has often been frequent media coverage of Franco, particularly regarding his interest in going to colleges. In addition to that, Franco has also claimed to have been strongly misquoted by reports in the media and news outlets reporting erroneous information about him. This led to the actor being parodied in an episode of SNL's Weekend Update segment, which an Entertainment Weekly writer deemed \"clever\". In a 2011 interview, he stated:\n\nI've been perceived as this guy yelling, 'Hey, look at me. I want attention'. I'm not going to school to get articles written about me. I'm just going to school. But the fact that I'm going to school or that someone takes a picture of me sleeping is like, 'We're gonna jump on that and criticize him for his antics'. What antics? I write. I make movies. I'm going to school. I hosted the Oscars. I take these projects seriously.\nFranco has deliberately garnered a reputation for publishing \"selfies\" and wrote an explanatory article for The New York Times in December 2013. Franco writes:\n\nBut a well-stocked collection of selfies seems to get attention. And attention seems to be the name of the game when it comes to social networking. In this age of too much information at a click of a button, the power to attract viewers amid the sea of things to read and watch is power indeed. It's what the movie studios want for their products, it's what professional writers want for their work, it's what newspapers want \u2014 hell, it's what everyone wants: attention. Attention is power.\nIn April 2012, Shalom Life ranked Franco and his brother, Dave, together as number two on its list of 50 talented and attractive Jewish men. In 2013, Franco was featured as the cover model and featured focus in the men's magazine Man of the World.In other forms of media, a Chicago-based theater company, Under the Gun Theater, developed a show inspired by and titled after Franco. The 2015 production of Dear James Franco used, parodied and deconstructed letters penned to or by celebrities. The performances used improvization to satirize their subject matter.\n\n\n=== Sexual misconduct accusations and lawsuit ===\nIn 2014, a 17-year-old girl posted screenshots of alleged messages between her and Franco on Instagram. The messages showed that Franco, who was 35 at the time, tried to meet her in a hotel room after she told him she was 17. Franco sent multiple pictures of himself to prove his real identity. Franco admitted on Live! With Kelly and Michael that he had written the messages. His actions were legal (the age of consent in New York is seventeen) but he was criticized by the media because of the wide age gap. He initially responded to the scandal with the tweet, \"I HOPE PARENTS KEEP THEIR TEENS AWAY FROM ME. Thank you.\" He later stated he was \"embarrassed\" and \"I learned my lesson.\"At the 2018 Golden Globes, Franco wore a Time's Up pin in solidarity with the #MeToo movement, to protest harassment against women. Franco's pin drew criticism on social media from actress Ally Sheedy, who hinted she had quit acting after working with Franco in a play. A former girlfriend, Violet Paley, also alleged that Franco once forced her to give him oral sex in a car while they were dating. On January 9, 2018, The New York Times canceled a planned event with James Franco, citing the allegations. On January 10, Franco said on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that the accusations made against him on Twitter were \"not accurate.\"On January 11, 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that five women were accusing Franco of inappropriate or sexually exploitative behavior while serving as their acting teacher or mentor. One former student stated that Franco \"would always make everybody think there were possible roles on the table if we were to perform sexual acts or take off our shirts\" in his projects. Another alleged that Franco held a sex scenes class and removed students' vaginal guards while simulating oral sex with them. Franco's attorney, Michael Plonsker, disputed these women's allegations.In Busy Philipps' 2018 memoir, she puts forth an account in which Franco screamed at her before violently shoving her to the ground while on the set of Freaks and Geeks.On October 3, 2019, two female former students of Franco's now-closed film and acting school, Studio 4, filed a lawsuit against him and his partners. According to The New York Times, the complaint alleges that the program \"was little more than a scheme to provide him and his male collaborators with a pool of young female performers that they could take advantage of.\" The case claims that pupils were subjected to \"sexually exploitative auditions and film shoots\" and had to sign away their rights to the recordings. The litigants are open to a class-action dispute and are seeking unspecified monetary damages as well as the return or destruction of any questionable material. Franco has denied the plaintiffs' claims through his attorney.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nFranco has described himself as Jewish; regarding his secular upbringing, he told The Guardian that he feels as if he has \"missed out on the Jewish experience\", but has been told not to worry about that by his Jewish friends and said in the same interview that he likes \"the idea of religion as a source of community\". When asked if he was a \"believer\", he responded, \"In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question.\" In 2015, he had an official Bar Mitzvah ceremony, presided over by a rabbi.\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nDue to his support for the LGBT community, and his portrayal of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. \"Or, you know what,\" he quipped, \"maybe I'm just gay.\" In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, stating, \"In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren't considered gay.\" He added, \"Well, I like to think that I'm gay in my art and straight in my life.\"After meeting on the set of Whatever It Takes in 1999, Franco dated co-star Marla Sokoloff for five years. He was later in a relationship with actress Ahna O'Reilly until 2011. He confirmed their separation in an interview for Playboy magazine's August 2011 issue, saying that his interest in education got between them.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nFranco, dissatisfied with his career's direction, reenrolled at UCLA in autumn 2006 as an English major with a creative writing concentration. He received permission to take as many as 62 course credits per quarter compared to the normal limit of 19, while still continuing to act, receiving many of his credits from independent study for his involvement on the set of Spider-Man 3. He received his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a GPA of 3.5/4.0. For his degree, Franco prepared his departmental honors thesis as a novel under the supervision of Mona Simpson.Franco was selected as the commencement speaker at UCLA, and was to speak at the ceremony on June 12, 2009. Several months before commencement, an editorial in the student newspaper questioned his \"caliber\" and a student created a Facebook page protesting the choice. On June 3, Franco withdrew, citing a date conflict with location pre-production on a film. On January 26, 2011, Franco and the Harvard Lampoon released a satirical video on prominent comedy website Funny or Die mocking his last-minute cancellation.Franco moved to New York to simultaneously attend graduate school at Columbia University School of the Arts for writing, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for filmmaking, and Brooklyn College for fiction writing, while also attending the low-residency MFA Program for Writers at North Carolina's Warren Wilson College for poetry. He received his M.F.A. from Columbia in 2010. As of 2010, Franco was studying in the Ph.D. program in English at Yale University He has also attended the Rhode Island School of Design.In an interview with Showbiz411, on September 23, 2010, Franco made the erroneous public announcement that he received a \"D\" grade in \"Acting\" class at the NYU Graduate Film School. He had, in fact, received that grade in a \"Directing the Actor\" class. Franco's professor, Jos\u00e9 Angel Santana, alleged that Franco did not earn his grades while attending that school and stated that Franco only received high marks and a degree because of his celebrity status as an actor. Franco made unfavorable comments about Santana's teaching. In September 2012, after having been terminated from his position Santana filed a lawsuit against Franco for defamation; Santana claimed that Franco's comments were false and had led to his termination. In September 2013, Franco and Santana settled the defamation lawsuit. \u201cThe matter has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties,\u201d said Santana's attorney Matthew Blit. Franco defended himself on the Howard Stern Show, stating that he had told the professor before the semester began that he would have to miss most classes to film 127 Hours and that they had agreed that Franco would receive a \"D\" in the course.In March 2013, Franco was featured in half-page print advertisements for his alma mater UCLA which celebrated the university's famous alumnus as a \"prolific academic\" and carried the tagline: \"Some A-Listers Actually Get A's\".\n\n\n== Charitable work ==\nFranco has said \"aiding others is the key to life, the key to happiness and, as an actor, you can get wrapped up in yourself and your career ... A little secret is one of the greatest ways to break that is to stop thinking about yourself for a second\". When Franco was at a point in his life where he wanted to give back but was unsure how, he asked his Spider-Man co-star Kirsten Dunst for advice. At her suggestion, he started volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, where she also volunteers, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.On March 31, 2011, the actor took part in \"An Evening with James Franco\", a Washington D.C. dinner benefit for 826DC, a non-profit foundation created to help neighborhood students reach their goals, as well as provide after-school literature programs and workshops that encourage them to improve their writing skills. Franco became involved with Dave Eggers' 826 National after Eggers asked him to do a conceptual idea for the program, and he directed a documentary for them and has since been a supporter of them. At the event, he spoke about how he thought schools needed to be more original with their literature programs. \"Writing can do things that video cannot\", he added. In April 2011, Franco autographed a T-shirt that would be auctioned off through the Yoshiki Foundation, with the proceeds being donated for Japanese tsunami relief. On June 14, he was honored by amfAR, the foundation for AIDS research, at the Museum of Modern Art. Franco received the Piaget Award of Inspiration for his humanitarian work and contributions to men's style.In April 2013, Franco received the Ally Award at the 15th annual Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. The award was presented to him in recognition of his unwavering support of the LGBT community.In April 2014, Franco presented at Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS Easter Bonnet Competition with Leighton Meester and Chris O'Dowd, after raising donations at his Broadway show Of Mice and Men. In June 2014, Franco performed in the BC/EFA benefit Broadway Bares.\n\n\n== Filmography and awards ==\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nFranco, James. \"A Star, a Soap and the Meaning of Art\".

Topics are usually offered on a one-time basis. Since the content of this course changes each time it is offered, it may be repeated for credit. Consult the department for section assignment.\n", "wiki_title": "Bjarne Stroustrup", "wiki_page": "Bjarne Stroustrup (; Danish: [\u02c8pja\u02d0n\u0259 \u02c8st\u0281\u028cw\u02c0st\u0281\u0254p]; born 30 December 1950) is a Danish computer scientist, most notable for the creation and development of the C++ programming language. He is a visiting professor at Columbia University, and works at Morgan Stanley as a Managing Director in New York.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nStroustrup was born in Aarhus, Denmark. His family was working class, and he went to the local schools.He attended Aarhus University 1969\u20131975 and graduated with a master's degree in mathematics and computer science. His interests focused on microprogramming and machine architecture. He learned the fundamentals of object-oriented programming from its inventor, Kristen Nygaard, who frequently visited Aarhus. \nIn 1979, he received a PhD in computer science from the University of Cambridge, where he was supervised by David Wheeler. His thesis concerned communication in distributed computer systems.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1979, Stroustrup began his career as a member of technical staff in the Computer Science Research Center of Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA. There, he began his work on C++ and programming techniques. Stroustrup was the head of AT&T Bell Labs' Large-scale Programming Research department, from its creation until late 2002. In 1993, he was made a Bell Lab's fellow and in 1996, an AT&T Fellow.\nFrom 2002 to 2014, Stroustrup was the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science Professor at Texas A&M University. From 2011, he was made a University Distinguished Professor.\nAs of January 2014, Stroustrup is a Technical Fellow and Managing Director in the technology division of Morgan Stanley in New York City and a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Columbia University.\n\n\n== C++ ==\nStroustrup is best known for his work on C++. In 1979, he began developing C++ (initially called \"C with Classes\"). In his own words, he \"invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation [...] chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee.\" C++ was made generally available in 1985. For non-commercial use, the source code of the compiler and the foundation libraries was the cost of shipping (US$75); this was before everyone had Internet access. Stroustrup also published a textbook for the language in 1985, The C++ Programming Language.\n\nThe key language-technical areas of contribution of C++ are:\n\nA static type system with equal support for built-in types and user-defined types (that requires control of the construction, destruction, copying, and movement of objects; and operator overloading).\nValue and reference semantics.\nSystematic and general resource management (RAII): constructors, destructor, and exceptions relying on them.\nSupport for efficient object-oriented programming: based on the Simula model with statically checked interfaces, multiple inheritance, and efficient implementation based on virtual function tables.\nSupport for flexible and efficient generic programming: templates with specialization and concepts.\nSupport for compile-time programming: template metaprogramming and compile-time evaluated functions (\"constexpr functions\").\nDirect use of machine and operating system resources .\nConcurrency support through libraries (where necessary, implemented using intrinsics).Stroustrup documented his principles guiding the design of C++ and the evolution of the language in his 1994 book \u201dThe Design and Evolution of C++\u201d and two papers for ACM's History of Programming Languages conferences.Stroustrup was a founding member of the C++ standards committee (from 1989, it was an ANSI committee and from 1991 an ISO committee) and has remained an active member ever since. For 24 years he chaired the subgroup chartered to handle proposals for language extensions (Evolution Working Group).\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nSelected honors\n2018: The Charles Stark Draper Prize from The US National Academy of Engineering for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language. This is the NEA's highest honor and one of the world's highest honors for an engineer.

{"name": "Betsy West", "department": "Journalism", "course_descr": null, "wiki_title": "Betsy Damon", "wiki_page": "\n== Early life and career ==\nBorn in 1940, Betsy Damon is an American artist whose work has been influenced by her activism in women's, gay, and environmental rights. She received her masters degree from Columbia University in 1966. After receiving her degree, she traveled to Germany but returned to the United States in 1968 where she learned of the Women's Movement from American artist Joyce Kozloff. In 1972 Damon attended Womanhouse. After this visit, she began creating street art performances in New York City. Her performance, The 7000 Year Old Woman in 1977 in New York City, addressed feminist themes of violence and oppression through a ritualistic performance.She has participated in a number of exhibitions and performances and her work has been featured in exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was a founding member of the Women's Caucus for Art and received the Mid-Life Career Award from the organization in 1989. She won the Arts and Healing Network Award in 2000. At the age of 50, Betsy Damon changed the focus of her art to center on water, the conservation and protection of water and how it impacts society. Her efforts in activist art influenced the annual San Antonio River clean up, as well as educated many people on the importance of water. She is an international water artist who primarily focuses on ecological works. Her work raised awareness in China as well, her best known project being The Living Water Garden in the city of Chengdu in Sichuan Province, China, the first water-themed ecological park in urban China. In 2009, Damon was named as a Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project.\n\n\n== Non-profit and NGO connections ==\nA goal of Damon was to eliminate sexism all over the world. From 1980-2000 Damon founded and directed No Limits for Women Artists an international organization that sought to improve female leadership and help men in becoming  independent allies. In her \"What is Creativity\" manifesto, Damon strongly asserted she believed \"creativity is the birthright of all people\" but it is something controlled by the government who feared its power in influencing social and political change. Art was activism to Damon. She believed the best way combat the exploitation of women was through uniting them together; her organization worked to foster strong connections among its members. Members were required to participate in daily telephone calls with each other. These calls gave women the opportunity to talk about their art and their goals for the day; increasing personal motivation and productivity.In 1991 Damon founded Keepers of the Waters, a nonprofit organization that serves as an international community to encourage \"art, science and community projects for the understanding and remediation of living water systems.\" The nonprofit is run with a collaborative approach and was started with the support of the Hubert Humphrey Institute.In 2006, Damon, alongside a group of artists, scientists, and funders, met in Vancouver and created a summary report for UNESCO titled \"Art in Ecology \u2013 A Think Tank on Arts and Sustainability.\" UNESCO had commissioned a report in advance of this meeting titled \"Mapping the Terrain of Contemporary EcoART Practice\", of which the meeting and summary report were a result.\n\n\n== Performance art/installation art ==\nIn the 1970s, Damon began to work as a performance artist. Her work explored the connection between women and nature, often through covering herself with natural materials such as feathers and bark.\n\n\n=== Performances ===\n\n\n==== 7000 Year Old Woman, 1977 ====\nIn 1977, she created a piece called The 7,000 Year Old Woman and performed it in New York City twice. The first performance happened on March 21st, 1977 at the Cayman Gallery. The second performance happened on May 21st, 1977 publicly on Prince Street near West Broadway. Damon commented that the figure that the 7000 year old woman embodies \"is my sister, mother, my grandmothers, my great grandmothers, friends and lovers. She is my woman line of 7,000 years. She is me, the me that I know very little about.\u201dThe Cayman Gallery performance took place in the presence of other women. Damon painted her body, hair and face in white and hung 420 small bags filled with colored flour on her body. A woman drew a spiral path for her to follow. Damon walked the spiral, cutting the bags on her body with a pair of scissors. The performance concluded with her surrounded by the empty bags; audience members were allowed to take them. Damon offered them in hopes that others would perform their own rites. Damon states in a recount of the performance, published in Heresies Vol. 3, (a Lesbian Art and Artists publication), that the work commented on time. She writes \"I came out of the piece with a knowledge about the burden of time. A woman sixty years old is maybe twenty times more burdened than the thirty year old by her story. If we had had7000 years of celebrated female energy this would be different.\"In the second performance on Prince Street, Damon performs the piece for the public. For this experience Damon recruits artist Su Friedrich to assist her. This time she was adorned with 400 bags of colored flour and contained within a sand circle. Friedrich was responsible for tying the bags onto Damon's exposed body. Men, women and children of all ages were the spectators in this performance. The audience was unpredictable. Her friends brought flowers while boys egged her. Damon walked the circle cutting the bags from her body and handing them to the audience. As more bags were given away her sense of vulnerability rose. In the Heresies article she states she finishes the piece by returning to the center of the circle.Damon comments that after that performance \"I never knew until that afternoon how completely all things female had been eradicated from our streets. So totally is this true we do not even notice that she is missing.\"\n\n\n==== Blind Beggar Woman and the Virgin Mary, 1979 ====\nIn a 1979 piece called Blind Beggarwoman and the Virgin Mary, Damon, as the central performer, dressed in rags and bags of dust, with gauze taped over her eyes. Crouching over a begging bowl filled with more pouches, she asked the spectators to whisper stories from their lives to her. The goal of the piece was to create a space where women's stories could be told. In Damon discussed the piece in an interview, saying  \"In that performance, I asked the question: who are the female Homers, the female storytellers, who were the containers of history and memory? On the street, I begged for stories from people\u2019s lives, while my eyes were covered with these very obvious patches. I practiced with a friend of mine who was blind. People started saying that I was the multi-breasted female goddess and stuff like that, but that was not the origin of this piece. May Stevens got it right\u2014she was the first to recognize that the work was also a mutilation image.\" The other performers either crouched low or sat on the floor, repeating \"gestures -a woman endlessly reciting beads to the Virgin, another transferring sawdust from one bucket to another, a third, dressed in a mound of the small pouches filled with colored powder, systematically slitting them open with a knife until she was nude-were suggestive of women's endurance and of the cyclic nature of women's work.\"  \n\n\n==== Rape Memory, 1980 ====\nAs part of The Great American Lesbian Art Show in Los Angeles in 1980, Damon performed Rape Memory. Against a chorus of voices trying to silence her, she attempted to share her own traumatic rape experience. They chanted \u201cYou can\u2019t talk, don\u2019t say that, don\u2019t say\u201d while she pleaded \u201cI\u2019m trying, let me, please let me talk.\u201d After an hour, she was allowed to describe an assault she experienced when she was two and a half years old. Audience members were allowed to share their own experiences, and they did after her performance. Damon sought to heal through community and encouraged women to speak out.\n\n\n=== Installations ===\n\n\n==== Shrine for Everywoman, 1980 ====\nAs part of the International Festival of Women Artists in 1980 in Copenhagen, Damon created an interactive installation piece. Damon invited women to write thoughts and stories down and took these thoughts and put them in small bags, hanging them in rows on cords like prayer flags. Women\u2019s thoughts formed a gathering space. A mandala, a buddhist symbol of the universe marked the space as a place of community. The contents of the bags contained stories, hopes, fears, and visions. Damon created a space of recovery and spirituality.\n\n\n== Exhibitions and major works ==\n\n\n=== Performances ===\n1985-90: The Shrine for Everywoman.\n1983-1989: A Mediation with Stones for the Survival of the Planet.\n1981-83: A Rape Memory.\n1979-81: Blind Beggar Woman.\n1977: 7,000 Year Old Woman, New York, N.Y.\n\n\n=== Shows ===\n2019: Keepers of the Waters: Lhasa & Chengdu, Taipei Biennial.\n2012: Feminist, and..., Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh, PA.\n1986-1991: A Memory of Clean Water, Everhart Museum.\n1990: An Homage to Rivers, Aspen Art Museum Biennial.\nJanuary 25 \u2013 March 22, 1987: Special Projects (Winter 1987), MoMA PS1.\nJanuary 17 \u2013 March 14, 1982: The Wild Art Show, MoMA PS1.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nDamon, Betsy. \"The 7,000 Year Old Woman,\" Heresies 1, no.3 (Fall 1977)\nForney, Matt. \"Environmentalism By Ordinary People is Perilous in China--U.S. Woman Makes Enemies But Perseveres to Help Clean Up Stinking River,\" The Wall Street Journal (Jul. 2000)\nCarruthers, Beth. \"Art, Sweet Art: Adaptive, Hybrid and Flexibe, EcoART Moves Hearts, Changes Minds and Ultimately Alters Behaviors,\" Alternatives Journal 32, no. 4-5 (Dec. 2006)\nJones, Diana. \"Development Project Uses Art to Control Water Flow in Larimer,\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Jan. 2015)\n\n\n=== Books ===\nMoyer, Twylene and Glenn Harper [ed.s].

He is one of the most popular touring acts in country music, regularly selling out the venues in which he performs. His 2007 Flip-Flop Summer Tour was the highest-grossing country road trip of the year.The Country Music Association honored Chesney with the Entertainer of the Year award in 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008. Other notable awards he received include the Academy of Country  Music's 1997 New Male Vocalist of the Year, 2002 Top Male Vocalist of the Year, and the Triple Crown Award in 2005. He was awarded his fourth consecutive Entertainer of the Year award from the Academy of Country Music on May 18, 2008.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nChesney was born on March 26, 1968, in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States, at St. Mary's Medical Center and was raised in Luttrell, and is of English and Irish descent. He is the son of David Chesney, a former elementary school teacher, and Karen Chandler, a hair stylist in the Knoxville area. Chesney has one sibling, a younger sister named Jennifer Chandler. In 1986, Chesney graduated from Gibbs High School, where he played baseball and football. He received his first guitar, \"The Terminor\", for Christmas and began teaching himself how to play it. Chesney studied advertising at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, where he was a member of the ETSU Bluegrass Program and the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and graduated in 1990. In 1989, he recorded a self-released demo album at the Classic Recording Studio in Bristol, Virginia. He sold 1,000 copies while performing at the local clubs in Johnson City and used the money from album sales to help himself buy a new guitar. After graduation from East Tennessee State in 1990, he headed to Nashville and performed at several local clubs, including The Bluebird Cafe. He became the resident performer at The Turf, a honky tonk bar in the city's historic district.\n\n\n== Career and awards ==\n\n\n=== Signing first publishing and record deals ===\nIn 1992, the head of writer relations at BMI, Clay Bradley, recommended Chesney to his friend, Troy Tomlinson, at Opryland Music Group by saying: \"I met this kid today from East Tennessee. He's a good singer, a good songwriter, and more than anything, I think you're going to really like him as a person.\" Chesney performed five songs during his audition for Tomlinson. Tomlinson's reaction was enthusiastic, later telling HitQuarters:\n\nFirst of all I was attracted to the songs, because I thought that he painted great pictures in his lyrics, particularly for someone who had not been around the typical Music Row co-writes. I thought that he sang very well too. But more than anything there was a kind of this 'I-will-do-it' look in his eyes \u2013 I was really drawn in by the fact that he was so set on being successful in this business.\nChesney left the audition with a songwriter's contract. A year later, an appearance at a songwriter's showcase led to a contract with Capricorn Records, which had recently started a country division.\n\n\n=== In My Wildest Dreams (1994) ===\nChesney's debut album, In My Wildest Dreams, was released on the independent Capricorn Records label in April 1994. The album's first two singles, \"Whatever It Takes\" and \"The Tin Man\", both reached the lower regions of the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The album sold approximately 10,000 copies before Capricorn Records closed its country music division in Nashville later that year and moved to Atlanta.\n\n\n=== All I Need to Know (1995) ===\nChesney then signed with BNA Records, and released his second studio album All I Need to Know in 1995. The album produced three singles. \"Fall in Love\" and the title track both reached the Top 10, while \"Grandpa Told Me So\" peaked at number 23. That same year, Chesney co-wrote Confederate Railroad's single \"When He Was My Age\" from their album When and Where. Chesney utilized fiddle and steel instrumentation within this album in order to highlight the down-home sentiments and the unique Tennessee twinge in his voice. This album seemed to capture the traditional spirit that made country music popular.\n\n\n=== Me and You (1996\u201397) ===\nChesney's third studio album and his second major-label one, entitled Me and You, was released in 1996. Its first single, \"Back In My Arms Again\", peaked just outside the Top 40 on the country charts, while its title track (which Chesney had recorded on his previous album) and \"When I Close My Eyes\" (which was previously recorded by Keith Palmer on his 1991 debut album and then by Larry Stewart on his 1993 debut album Down the Road) both peaked at number 2. Me and You was Chesney's first album to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A cover of Mac McAnally's 1990 single \"Back Where I Come From\" was also included on this album. Even though Chesney's version was never released as a single, it has been regularly performed during his concerts. In recognition of his successful year, Chesney was honored with the 1997 Academy of Country Music's New Male Vocalist of the Year award.\n\n\n=== I Will Stand (1997\u201398) ===\nI Will Stand, Chesney's fourth album and his third from BNA Records, followed in 1997. The album's first single, \"She's Got It All\", became Chesney's first number one hit on the Billboard country charts and spent three weeks at that position. The album's second single, \"A Chance\", peaked just shy of the Top 10. The third single, \"That's Why I'm Here\", peaked at number 2 in 1998.\n\n\n=== Everywhere We Go (1999) ===\nEverywhere We Go, Chesney's fourth album from BNA, came in 1999. That album produced two consecutive number one hits with \"How Forever Feels\" and \"You Had Me from Hello\" (the latter inspired by a line in the movie Jerry Maguire). The album also produced two more singles with \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" and \"What I Need to Do\", which peaked at numbers 11 and 8 on the country charts, respectively. Everywhere We Go was Chesney's first album to be certified platinum. The album marked a departure from his original neotraditional country sound, to his more familiar country pop/trop rock/Gulf and Western sound he has since become known for.\n\n\n=== Greatest Hits (2000) ===\nBy 2000, Chesney released his Greatest Hits compilation album. It included four new tracks, as well as updated versions of \"Fall in Love\", \"The Tin Man\", and \"Back Where I Come From\". The new version of \"The Tin Man\" was one of the disc's three singles, along with two of the new tracks, \"I Lost It\" and \"Don't Happen Twice\". In 2001 he performed with Kid Rock at a Waylon Jennings tribute concert covering Waylon's song Luckenbach Texas.\n\n\n=== No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems (2002\u201303) ===\nThe album No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems was released in 2002. Its lead-off single, \"Young\", peaked at number 2, while the follower \"The Good Stuff\" spent seven weeks at number 1 and became Billboard's number one country song of the year for 2002. The video for \"Young\" was honored by CMT with the Video of the Year and Male Video of the Year awards for 2002. In 2003, ACM honored Chesney as Top Male Vocalist of the Year, while \"The Good Stuff\" received the award for Single Record of the Year. CMT later recognized the video for the album's title track as the Hottest Video of the Year.\n\n\n=== All I Want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan (2003) ===\nIn 2003, Chesney recorded All I Want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan. The album's title track peaked at No. 30 on the country charts from holiday airplay. Other notable work Chesney did in 2003 is that he co wrote Kid Rock's single \"Cold and Empty\" from his self-titled 6th studio album Kid Rock.\n\n\n=== When the Sun Goes Down (2004\u201305) ===\n2004 saw the release of the album When the Sun Goes Down. Its lead-off single, \"There Goes My Life\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard country charts. On April 21, 2004, the accompanying music video for that song was honored by CMT with the Male Video of the Year award. The album's title track, a duet with Uncle Kracker, also went to number one. The music video for the album's third single, \"I Go Back\", was honored on April 11, 2005 with Country Music Television's Male Video of the Year Award. This song, along with the album's fourth single, \"The Woman with You\", both peaked at number 2. The fifth single, \"Anything But Mine\", reached number one, and the final single, \"Keg in the Closet\", peaked to number 6.When the Sun Goes Down was honored with the 2004 CMA award for Album of the Year while Chesney was honored as the Entertainer of the Year. He was also presented with AMA's 2004 Artist of the Year award.\n\n\n=== Be as You Are and The Road and the Radio (2005\u201306) ===\nIn January 2005, Chesney released the album Be as You Are (Songs from an Old Blue Chair), supporting it with his Somewhere in the Sun Tour. Be as You Are is composed mostly of ballads. The album qualified for RIAA Platinum  and entered the top of both mainstream country and pop music.\nIn spring 2005, Chesney was honored with the prestigious Triple-Crown Award presented by the Academy of Country Music. This award was presented after Chesney's 2004 Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year award was combined with 1997's New Male Vocalist of the Year award and 2003's Top Male Vocalist of the Year award. The following year, on May 23, 2006, Chesney was honored with his second Entertainer of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards.Chesney's next album, The Road and the Radio, produced five singles. \"Living in Fast Forward\", \"Summertime\", and \"Beer in Mexico\" all reached number one, while \"Who You'd Be Today\" and \"You Save Me\" both broke the Top 5. Chesney promotes his beliefs of perfection, as getting songs right in the studio, ultimately leads to performing it right on the road and on the radio.\n\n\n=== Live: Live Those Songs Again (2006) ===\nLive: Live Those Songs Again, Chesney's first live album was released on September 19, 2006 via BNA Records. This album includes live renditions of 15 songs, 11 of which were singles. \"Live Those Songs\", \"Never Gonna Feel Like That Again\", \"On the Coast of Somewhere Beautiful\", and \"Back Where I Come From\" were never released by Chesney as singles, although \"Back Where I Come From\" was released as a single from Mac McAnally's 1990 album Simple Life.\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nChesney collaborated with one of his personal heroes, Jimmy Buffett, on a remake of Hank Williams' single \"Hey Good Lookin' (with Clint Black, Alan Jackson, Toby Keith, and George Strait), and a second song \"License To Chill\". Both songs are on Buffett's 2004 album License To Chill.Chesney, along with Tim McGraw, contributed to a version of Tracy Lawrence's single \"Find Out Who Your Friends Are\", which can be found on his album For the Love. The official single version, only featuring Lawrence's vocals, was released in August 2006 but did not reach the Top 40 on the country charts until January 2007, when 'the album was released. After the album's release, the version with him, Chesney, and McGraw began receiving significant airplay, helping to boost the single to No. 1 on the country charts. The song became Lawrence's first No. 1 single in 11 years, as well as the second-slowest climbing No. 1 single in the history of the Billboard music charts.With Neil Thrasher and Wendell Mobley, Chesney also co-wrote Rascal Flatts' 2007 single Take Me There\", which served as the lead-off single to their album Still Feels Good.Chesney also recorded a duet with Reba McEntire on her No. 1 2007 album Reba: Duets. \"Every Other Weekend\" peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and No. 104 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The album has sold 2.1 million copies world-wide and is certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales of over 1 million. \"Every Other Weekend\" was the final single from the album.\n\n\n=== Super Hits (2007) ===\nOn November 7, 2007, Chesney was named the CMA Entertainer of the Year for the third time in four years. The following week, on November 15, 2007, the compilation Super Hits album was released as part of Sony BMG's Super Hits series.\n\n\n=== Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates (2007\u20132008) ===\nOn September 11, 2007, Chesney released the album Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates. This album represented a move to a more gulf and western sound with a number of \"breezy, steel-drum island songs\". Kanye West and 50 Cent's albums Graduation and Curtis were both released that same day. Those artists were in the midst of a competitive sales war, with the latter claiming that he would end his solo rap career if West sold more albums than he did (remarks he later retracted as terms of his contract conflicted with the promise). Chesney, however, decided that he would give country music a place in the competition, claiming country artists were just as popular as those in the rap genre. Chesney came in third place in record sales among the three musical artists.The lead-off single from Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates was \"Never Wanted Nothing More\". That song became Chesney's twelfth number one hit on the Billboard country charts.  On the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated for the week ending on September 15, 2007, the album's second single \"Don't Blink\" debuted at No. 16, setting a new record for the highest debut on that chart since the inception of SoundScan electronic tabulation in 1990. This record was broken one week later by Garth Brooks' \"More Than a Memory\", which debuted at No. 1 on the same chart, making it the first song ever to do so. The third single, \"Shiftwork\" (a duet with George Strait) peaked at No. 2 on the country charts. During the week of June 28, 2008, the fourth and final single, \"Better as a Memory\", became Chesney's fourteenth number one hit.\n\nChesney started his Poets and Pirates Tour on April 26, 2008 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the introduction of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and the lip of the stage surface, which crushed his foot causing a severe hematoma in the ankle; most of the damage was centering within his toes. It took about 30 seconds for Chesney to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and held his hand on his knee as he began singing.Chesney did not acknowledge the injury during the early part of his performance. However, he was visibly limping and seemed to rest near a drum riser while leaning over and holding his knee during the instrumental breaks of his songs. As he came offstage, a doctor from the University of South Carolina cut off Chesney's cowboy boot and immediately began treating the foot injury. X-rays that were taken afterwards revealed several crushed bones in his right foot.That injury did not have him cancel any shows, as saying \"[the doctor] told me it's going to hurt \u2013 though nothing could hurt worse than Saturday, I don't think \u2013 and they can give me something to deaden the pain when I get out there. I also have to have a doctor standing by should something give, but I'm going to tape it up, and I'm going to get out there\".On May 19, 2008, just a day after being honored as the ACM Entertainer of the Year at the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards, Chesney criticized the lack of choice in the producers' awarding the honor based on fan votes. \"The entertainer of the year trophy is supposed to represent heart and passion and an amazing amount of sacrifice, commitment and focus\", he said. \"That's the way Garth [Brooks] won it four times, that's the way I won it, that's the way [George] Strait won it, Reba [McEntire], Alabama all those years. That's what it's supposed to represent.\"\n\n\n=== Lucky Old Sun (2008\u20132009) ===\n\nOn July 24, 2008, Chesney announced that he would be releasing a new single from an upcoming album entitled Lucky Old Sun. The song was titled \"Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven\", and for the chart week of August 16, 2008, it debuted at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The album was released on October 14, 2008. \"Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven\" became a No. 1 hit. It was followed by a cover of Mac McAnally's 1990 single \"Down the Road\".Chesney's 2009 tour was titled the Sun City Carnival Tour and featured both small and large venues in order to keep his ticket prices down. The tour included a performance at Gillette Stadium again, marking the fifth year in a row that he played at the Foxboro, Massachusetts football field.\n\n\n=== Greatest Hits II (2010) ===\nIn May 2009, Chesney released his second compilation album, Greatest Hits II. This album included the No. 1 hit, \"Out Last Night\", as the lead single. On February 9, 2010, this album was re-released with two new tracks \"This Is Our Moment\" and \"Ain't Back Yet\", with the latter becoming the album's third single in February 2010. Also included on this album is one that Willie Nelson recorded before Chesney did, \"I'm Alive\". Chesney himself later recorded a version of the song as a duet with Dave Matthews. This version was released in August 2009 as the album's second single.\n\n\n=== Hemingway's Whiskey (2010\u20132011) ===\nIn July 2010, Chesney released \"The Boys of Fall\" as the lead-off single from his album Hemingway's Whiskey, which was released in September 2010.

The song debuted at No. 35 on the country chart for the week of November 6, 2010. Both it and its followup, \"Live a Little\", went to number 1 on the country charts. The next single was \"You and Tequila\", co-written and originally recorded by Deana Carter. Chesney's rendition, which featured Grace Potter on backing vocals, went to number 3. After it, \"Reality\" also went to number 1.Chesney produced and narrated a biographical film, The Color Orange, on his favorite football player growing up, University of Tennessee quarterback and Canadian Football League hall-of-fame Condredge Holloway. The film was produced for ESPN's \"Year of the Quarterback\" series, and premiered on February 20, 2011.\n\n\n=== Welcome to the Fishbowl (2012) ===\nChesney released his fourteenth studio album, Welcome to the Fishbowl, on June 19, 2012. Its lead-off single, a Tim McGraw duet titled \"Feel Like a Rock Star\", debuted at number 13 on the country charts, making it the second-highest debuting country song since the Billboard charts were first tabulated via Nielsen SoundScan, and the highest-debuting duet on that chart. Despite its high debut, the song peaked at number 11 only six weeks later before falling.BNA Records closed in June 2012. As a result, Chesney was transferred to Columbia Nashville. His first release under Columbia was the album's second single, \"Come Over\", which went to number 1. The album's third and final single was \"El Cerrito Place\", which was written by Keith Gattis and originally recorded by Charlie Robison. Chesney's rendition, which featured Grace Potter on backing vocals, went to number 10 on the country charts.\n\n\n=== Life on a Rock (2013) ===\nChesney released his fifteenth studio album, Life on a Rock, on April 30, 2013. The first single from the album, \"Pirate Flag\", was released to iTunes on February 5, 2013 and peaked at number 3 on the Country Airplay chart in May 2013. Pirate Flag peaked at number 7 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, May 25, 2013. The album's second single, \"When I See This Bar\", was released to country radio on June 10, 2013. When I see This Bar peaked at number 25 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, September 14, 2013. This specific album was a drastic change from his regular country feel, to an all beach and island touch.\n\n\n=== The Big Revival (2014) ===\nIn June 2014, Chesney released the new song \"American Kids\" to radio. This song served as the lead-off single from his sixteenth studio album The Big Revival, which was released on September 23, 2014. The album's second single, \"Til It's Gone\", was released in mid-October. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart the week of January 31, 2015.

The term No Shoes Nation originated from Chesney's hit song \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem\". The symbol of No Shoes Nation is a black flag with a white skull and crossbones. The name was accompanied by a live album called Live in No Shoes Nation, which topped the Billboard 200 after its release in late 2017.

The album debuted at number one and became Chesney's 16th top 10 album on the US Billboard 200, with 233,000 units.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 2000, Chesney and Tim McGraw became involved in a scuffle with police officers in Buffalo, New York, after Chesney attempted to ride a police horse. McGraw came to Chesney's aid after police officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen. The two were arrested and charged, Chesney for disorderly conduct and McGraw for assault, but were acquitted in 2001.On May 9, 2005, Chesney married actress Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in a ceremony on the island of St. John. They had met in January at a tsunami relief event. On September 15 of that same year, after only four months of marriage, they announced their plans for an annulment. Zellweger cited fraud as the reason in the related papers, and after media scrutiny of her use of the word \"fraud\", she qualified the use of the term, stating that it was \"simply legal language and not a reflection of Kenny's character.\" Chesney later suggested the failure of his marriage was due to \"the fact that I panicked.\"  In an interview by 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper, Chesney commented on the failed marriage, \"The only fraud that was committed was me thinking that I knew what it was like\u2026 that I really understood what it was like to be married, and I really didn't.\" The annulment was finalized in late December 2005.\nIn 2015, Forbes estimated Chesney's annual income at $42 million.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2017, Chesney came to the aid of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands victims of Hurricane Irma, one of whom was given a free lift to the mainland United States. Chesney owns a mansion on St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where many stayed to weather the storm. Chesney also set up a charitable fund, Love for Love City, to help victims of the storm.

{"name": "Mark Mazower", "department": "History", "course_descr": "How do international and global perspectives shape and conceptualization, research, and writing of history? Topics include approaches to comparative history and transnational processes, the relationship of local, regional, national, and global scales of analysis, and the problem of periodization when considered on a world scale.\n", "wiki_title": "Mark Mazower", "wiki_page": "Mark Mazower (; born 20 February 1958) is a British historian. His expertise are Greece, the Balkans and, more generally, 20th-century Europe. He is Ira D. Wallach Professor of History at Columbia University in New York City.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMazower was born in Golders Green and spent most of his early life in north London. His mother was a physiotherapist and his father worked for Unilever. During his youth, Mazower enjoyed playing the French horn and composing classical music.Mazower's father was of Russian Jewish descent. When Mazower began to write his book What You Did Not Tell: A Russian Past and the Journey Home, he discovered that his grandfather, Max, was a member of the Bund, a Jewish socialist party, was involved in revolutionary activities, and helped print illegal books in Yiddish advocating socialism. Max was regularly arrested by the Tsarist police and was imprisoned twice in Siberia, before eventually fleeing the country and settling in England in 1924. Mazower also discovered that his grandparents continued to hang out with Russian-Jewish revolutionaries in Golders Green. Reflecting on the discovery, Mazower said:\n\nGrowing up in Golders Green was a weird experience for me because this place has no history. It was a big revelation to discover that Golders Green in the 1920s was full of these super-important world anarchists, who were hanging out with my grandparents and recovering from the revolution. It suddenly made the whole place make sense.\nDuring his youth, Mazower enjoyed reading classical literature and philosophy.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMazower received his BA in Classics and Philosophy from the University of Oxford in 1981 and his doctorate from the same university in 1988. He also holds an MA in International Affairs from Johns Hopkins University (1983). Prior to his arrival at Columbia, Mazower taught at Birkbeck, University of London, the University of Sussex and Princeton University.Mazower has also written for newspapers since 2002 such as the Financial Times and for The Independent contributing articles on international affairs and book reviews.He has been appointed to the Advisory Board of the European Association of History Educators (EUROCLIO).\n\n\n== Fields of interest ==\nMazower has written extensively on Greek and Balkan history. His book The Balkans won the Wolfson History Prize and Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941\u201344, both won the Longman History Today Award for Book of the Year. Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430\u20131950 was the Runciman Prize and Duff Cooper Prize winner and was shortlisted for the Hessell-Tiltman Prize.In addition, Mazower is more broadly concerned with 20th-century European history. His book Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century argued that the triumph of democracy in Europe was not inevitable but rather the result of chance and political agency on the part of citizens, subjects and leaders. \nIn Hitler's Empire: Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe, Mazower compared Nazi German occupation policy in different European countries.\nMazower's book, No Enchanted Palace, was published in 2009. It narrates the origins of the United Nations and its strict ties to colonialism and its predecessor organisation, the League of Nations. In Governing the World (2012), this narrative is taken one step further, and the history of international organisations in general is evaluated, beginning with the Concert of Europe at the start of the nineteenth century.\nMazower's 2018 inter-generational biography of his own family, What you did not tell, described their lives, education and politics and how it influences his interest in history, place, and the writing of biography. Caroline Moorehead, an acclaimed biographer, on reviewing this book, wrote of his scholarly reconstruction of a family's life meticulously drawn from archives and collections of papers in the UK, Russia, Belgium and Israel and family dairies, letters and interviews. Not simply a biographical narrative, Moorehead explains, since woven into it is a vast and rich picture of left wing European Jewry from the founding of the Bund workers' union. HIs prodigious historical reach is matched by his affectionate portrait of a family and a people 'whose fight for justice was based on their own personal knowledge of poverty and exploitation.'\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn his interview with Mazower, John Crace wrote Mazower \"likes walking, football, swimming in Hampstead ponds and dislikes commuting and celebrity culture\".\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nDido Sotiriou Award of the Hellenic Authors Society, 2012\nSociety of Columbia Graduates Great Teacher Award - 2011\nHonorary doctorate from KU Leuven (during the celebrations of the 30th anniversary of the Master of European Studies) - 2019\n\n\n=== Book Awards ===\nHitler's Empire: Trilling Award - 2009\nHitler's Empire: LA Times Book Prize for History - 2009\nSalonica, City of Ghosts: Duff Cooper Prize - 2005\nSalonica, City of Ghosts: John Criticos Prize - 2005\nSalonica, City of Ghosts: Runciman Prize - 2005\nSalonica, City of Ghosts: National Jewish Book Award - 2005\nDark Continent: German History Book Prize - 2002\nThe Balkans: Wolfson Prize for History - 2001\nThe Balkans: Adolphe Bentinck Prize - 2001\nDark Continent: Premio Acqui Storia - 2001\n\n\n==== Shortlisted for ====\nGoverning the World: Hessell-Tiltman Prize - 2013\n\n\n== Publications ==\nMazower's publications include:\n\nGoverning the World: The History of an Idea (Penguin Group, 13 September 2012.

{"name": "David Bell", "department": "Population and Family Health", "course_descr": null, "wiki_title": "Joshua Bell", "wiki_page": "Joshua David Bell (born December 9, 1967) is an American violinist and conductor. He plays the Gibson Stradivarius.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBell was born in Bloomington, Indiana, to Shirley Bell, a therapist, and Alan P. Bell, a psychologist, professor emeritus at Indiana University, and former Kinsey researcher. His father is of Scottish descent, and his mother is Jewish (his maternal grandfather was born in then Palestine (now Israel) and his maternal grandmother was from Minsk).Bell began playing the violin at age four after his mother discovered that he had taken rubber bands from around the house and stretched them across the handles of his nine dresser drawers to pluck out music he had heard her play on the piano. His parents got a scaled-to-size violin for him when he was five and started giving him lessons. Bell took to the instrument but had an otherwise normal Indiana childhood, playing video games and excelling at sports, especially tennis and bowling. He placed in a national tennis tournament at age ten.Bell's first violin teacher was Donna Bricht, widow of Indiana University music faculty member Walter Bricht. His second was Mimi Zweig, and his third the violinist and pedagogue Josef Gingold, who accepted Bell as a student after his parents assured him that they were not interested in pushing their son to be a star but simply wanted him to have the best teacher for his abilities. By age 12, Bell was serious about the instrument, thanks in large part to Gingold's inspiration.\nAt age 14, Bell appeared as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti. He studied violin at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music and graduated from Bloomington High School North in 1984. In 1989 Bell received an Artist Diploma in violin performance from Indiana University. IU also honored him with a Distinguished Alumni Service Award two years after his graduation. He has been named an \"Indiana Living Legend\" and received the Indiana Governor's Arts Award.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBell made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1985, at age 17, with the St. Louis Symphony. He has since performed with many of the world's major orchestras and conductors. As well as the standard concerto repertoire, Bell has performed new works. Nicholas Maw's violin concerto is dedicated to Bell, who premiered it in 1993 and won a Grammy Award for his recording of it. He performed the solo part on John Corigliano's Oscar-winning soundtrack to the film The Red Violin and was featured in Ladies in Lavender. Bell also appeared in the movie Music of the Heart, with other notable violinists.\nBell's instrument is the Gibson ex Huberman, a Stradivarius made in 1713 during what is known as Stradivari's \"Golden Era\". This violin was stolen twice from its previous owner, Bronis\u0142aw Huberman; the last time the thief confessed to the act on his deathbed. Bell had held and played the violin, and its owner at the time, violinist Norbert Brainin, jokingly told Bell that the violin could be his for $4 million. On 3 August 2001, Bell was in London to perform at The Proms, and stopped by J & A Beare before the concert. He learned that the violin was there and about to be sold to a German industrialist to become part of a collection. Bell played the violin at that Proms concert that same evening. He later sold his previous violin, the Tom Taylor Stradivarius, for a little more than $2 million and bought the Gibson ex Huberman for a little under the $4 million asking price. The 2013 documentary The Return of the Violin tells the story of the instrument's theft, return, and subsequent acquisition by Bell. Bell's first recording made with the Gibson ex Huberman was Romance of the Violin for Sony Classical Records in 2003.\nBell served an artistic partner for the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra from 2004 until 2007, and as a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He also serves on the artists' selection committee for the Kennedy Center Honors and is an adjunct associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Bell was awarded the Avery Fisher Prize on April 10, 2007, at Lincoln Center in New York City. The prize is given once every few years to classical instrumentalists for outstanding achievement. On May 3, 2007, the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music announced that Bell had joined the faculty as a senior lecturer.Bell collaborated with film composer Hans Zimmer by providing violin solos for the soundtrack of the 2009 film Angels & Demons, based on Dan Brown's 2000 novel of the same name.\nIn May 2011 Bell was named the new Music Director of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields (ASMF). He has recorded commercially with the ASMF for the Sony Classical label. In July 2017 the ASMF announced a three-year extension of Bell's contract, through 2020. Bell and the orchestra won the 2017 Helpmann Award for Best Individual Classical Music Performance.In 2013 Bell accompanied Scarlett Johansson in the song \"Before My Time\". Written by J. Ralph for the documentary Chasing Ice, the song received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.Bell played himself in three episodes of Mozart in the Jungle in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In 2016 he had a cameo in the penultimate musical episode of Royal Pains. He also appeared as himself in episode 8 (\"Quacktice Makes Perfect\") of the 2017 Netflix original series Julie's Greenroom.\n\n\n== Washington Post experiment ==\nIn an experiment initiated by The Washington Post columnist Gene Weingarten, Bell donned a baseball cap and played as an incognito busker at the Metro subway station L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C. on January 12, 2007. The experiment was videotaped on hidden camera; of the 1,097 people who passed by, seven stopped to listen to him, and one recognized him. For his nearly 45-minute performance, Bell collected $32.17 from 27 passersby (excluding $20 from the one who recognized him). Three days before, he earned considerably more playing the same repertoire at a concert. Weingarten won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his article on the experiment. The Washington Post posted the video on YouTube and a feature-length documentary, Find Your Way: A Busker's Documentary, chronicled Bell's experience.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBell lives in the Gramercy Park neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City. He has three sisters. Bell and a former girlfriend, Lisa Matricardi, have a son, Josef, born in 2007, and twin sons born in 2010. On October 5, 2019, he married opera singer Larisa Martinez at their home in Mount Kisco, New York.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Soundtrack albums ===\nChasing Ice Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 2012\nThe Flowers of War Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 2012: Joshua Bell, solo violin\nAngels & Demons Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 2009\nDefiance Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 2008\nLadies in Lavender Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 2005: Joshua Bell, solo violin\nIris Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 2001: Joshua Bell, solo violin\nThe Red Violin, Joshua Bell, solo Violin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nJoshua Bell at AllMusic\nJoshua Bell on IMDb\nJoshua Bell on IMG Artists, General Management\n\"Bell Man\", by Mandy Katz; in-depth profile in moment magazine\nInterview on The Diane Rehm Show radio program\nRecording of Bell's performance in L'Enfant Plaza\nBach & friends Documentary\nClassical Archives interview", "label": 0}

In the Enlightenment colloquium we will look at English and European imaginative and intellectual life during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. During this period, writers tried in new ways to reconcile the tensions between reason and religion. Categories of thought that underlie our world today were taking shape: secularity, progress, the public and the private, individual rights, religious tolerance. Writers articulated principles of equality in an era of slavery. Literary forms like the novel, which emerges into prominence during this period, express in irreducibly complex ways these and other changes. In this intensive course, we will study from multiple angles a variety of authors that may include Hobbes, Dryden, Locke, Spinoza, Lafayette, Defoe, Swift, Pope, Richardson, Voltaire, Fielding, Johnson, Diderot, Sterne, and Wollstonecraft, among others.\n", "wiki_title": "James Basker", "wiki_page": "Professor James G.

He is best known for making big-budget, high-concept action films characterized by fast cutting, stylistic visuals and extensive use of special effects, including frequent depictions of explosions. The films he has produced and directed, which include Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001) and the Transformers film series (2007\u2013present), have grossed over US$7.8 billion worldwide, making him one of the most commercially successful directors in history.He is co-founder of commercial production house The Institute, a.k.a. The Institute for the Development of Enhanced Perceptual Awareness. He co-owns Platinum Dunes, a production house which has remade horror movies including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), The Amityville Horror (2005), The Hitcher (2007), Friday the 13th (2009) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010).Despite his commercial success at the box office, Bay's work is generally held in low esteem by film critics. While The Rock (1996) and Transformers (2007) received moderately positive reviews, his other films, including the four Transformers sequels, have been received negatively by critics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMichael Bay was born in Los Angeles. He was raised by his adoptive parents Harriet, a bookstore owner/child psychiatrist, and Jim, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Bay was raised Jewish. His grandfather was from Russia. His cousin, Susan Bay, is the widow of Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy (whom he eventually cast as the voice actor for Sentinel Prime in Transformers: Dark of the Moon). He attended the exclusive Crossroads School, in Santa Monica, California. Bay often traces his interest in action films back to an incident during his childhood. As a boy, he attached some firecrackers to a toy train and filmed the ensuing fiery disaster with his mother's 8 millimeter camera. The fire department was called and he was grounded.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBay got his start in the film industry interning with George Lucas when he was fifteen, filing the storyboards for Raiders of the Lost Ark, which he thought was going to be terrible. His opinion changed after seeing it in the theater and he was so impressed by the experience that he decided to become a film director. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1986, majoring in both English and Film. He was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity and a favorite student of film historian Jeanine Basinger. For his graduate work, he attended Art Center College of Design in Pasadena where he also studied film.Michael Bay began working at Propaganda Films, directing commercials and music videos, two weeks after finishing his post-graduate degree. His 90-second World War II-inspired Coca-Cola advertisement was picked up by Capitol Records. His first national commercial was for the Red Cross, which won a Clio Award in 1992. He directed Goodby, Silverstein & Partners \"Got Milk?\" advertisement campaign for the California Milk Processors Board in 1993, which also won a Grand Prix Clio Award for Commercial of the Year.Bay's success in music videos gained the attention of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who selected him to direct his first feature-length film, Bad Boys. The film was shot in Miami in 1994 and starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The action film proved to be a break-out role for Smith, who was segueing from television to films at that time. Shooting in Miami was a good experience for Bay, who would later own a home in the city and spend a great deal of time there. The film was completed for $19 million and grossed a remarkable $141 million at the box office in the summer of 1995. Bay's success led to a strong partnership and friendship with Jerry Bruckheimer.His follow-up film, The Rock (1996), was an action movie set on Alcatraz Island, and in the San Francisco Bay area. It starred Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris. It was also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, the latter of whom died five months before the film's release. The film is dedicated to him. Connery and Cage won 'Best On-Screen Duo' at the MTV Movie Awards in 1997 and the film was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Achievement in Sound category for the work of Greg P. Russell, Kevin O'Connell, and Keith A. Wester. After the success of The Rock, Bay established his production company Bay Films, with a two-picture deal with Disney.\n\nIn 1998, Bay collaborated with Jerry Bruckheimer again, this time as a co-producer, as well as directing the action-adventure film Armageddon. The film, about a group of tough oil drillers who are sent by NASA to deflect an asteroid away from a collision course with Earth, starred Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. It was nominated for 4 Oscars at the 71st Academy Awards including Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing, and Best Original Song. The film earned 9.6 million dollars on its opening day and a total of 36.5 million through the first weekend. The production budget, $140 million, was one of the highest of the summer of 1998. Armageddon went on to gross over $553 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of that year.In 2001, Bay directed Pearl Harbor. It starred Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale and Cuba Gooding, Jr. The film was released on Memorial Day weekend in 2001. Again, Bay produced the film with Jerry Bruckheimer. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing and Best Song. Again, Kevin O'Connell received another nomination for Best Sound, but he did not win. Pearl Harbor won in the category for Sound Editing, making it Bay's first (and, to date, only) film to win an Oscar. Michael Bay also directed the music video for nominated track \"There You'll Be\" by vocal artist Faith Hill.Bay reteamed with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence for Bad Boys II, a sequel which also marked Bay's fifth collaboration with Jerry Bruckheimer. The film grossed $138 million domestically, enough to cover the production budget, and $273 million worldwide, almost twice as much as the first movie.\nIn 2005, Bay directed The Island, a science fiction film starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. It was the first film Bay made without Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer. The Island cost $126 million to produce and earned $36 million domestically and $127 million overseas making a worldwide total of $163 million. Bay stated that he was not comfortable with the domestic marketing campaign, as it confused the audience to the true subject of the film.\n\nIn 2007, he directed and teamed up with Steven Spielberg to produce Transformers, a live action film based on the Transformers franchise. The film was released in the U.S. and Canada on July 3, 2007, with 8 p.m. preview screenings on July 2. The previews earned $8.8 million, and in its first day of general release it grossed $27.8 million, a record for Tuesday box office attendance. It broke the record held by Spider-Man 2 for the biggest July 4 gross, making $29 million. On its opening weekend, Transformers grossed $70.5 million, amounting to a $155.4 million opening week, giving it the record for the biggest opening week for a non-sequel. As of November 2007, the film has made over $319 million domestically and over $709 million worldwide. Bay returned as director and executive producer for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which was released on June 24, 2009 and went on to gross over $832 million worldwide. Although it received mostly negative reviews by critics, including aggressively critical reviews by American film critics such as Roger Ebert, Michael Phillips and David Denby (who referred to Bay as \"stunningly, almost viciously, untalented\"), the film was well received by its intended audience and was one of the highest-grossing films of 2009. In 2010, it earned seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations and winning three: Worst Picture, Worst Director and Worst Screenplay. It was also one of the best selling DVD and Blu-ray Discs of 2009, second only to Twilight in DVD format and the number one of all time in Blu-ray format until it was surpassed by Blu-ray sales of James Cameron's Avatar in April 2010.\nBay directed Transformers: Dark of the Moon, released on June 29, 2011. which went on to gross $1.123 billion globally. His next film was a comparatively small film he had been developing for years, called Pain & Gain. The true crime story, based on events described in a Miami New Times article written by Pete Collins, concerns a group of bumbling bodybuilders working together to commit a robbery. It starred Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, Anthony Mackie, Tony Shalhoub and Ed Harris.\nBay produced DreamWorks' I Am Number Four, based on a series of novels by Pittacus Lore published by HarperCollins Children's Books. D. J. Caruso (Eagle Eye, Disturbia) directed.A fourth Bay-directed Transformers movie, Transformers: Age of Extinction, was released in June 2014. Starring Mark Wahlberg, the film earned $1.1 billion at the global box office  On January 12, 2016, Paramount Pictures released 13 Hours, which Bay produced and directed, based on the 2012 Benghazi attack. While being the lowest-grossing film at the box office of Bay's career, it went on to massive DVD sales upon its digital release in May 2016, earning over $40 million in home video revenue.On May 23, 2017, Bay was honored with his own Hand and Footprint Ceremony at The TCL Chinese Theatre. His English Mastiff, Rebel, also put her paw in the cement with Bay.In 2018, it was announced that Bay would direct the Netflix action thriller film 6 Underground, starring Ryan Reynolds, M\u00e9lanie Laurent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Adria Arjona, Corey Hawkins, Ben Hardy and Dave Franco. The film was released on December 13, 2019.His next film would be a pandemic-themed thriller entitled Songbird featuring Demi Moore, Craig Robinson, Paul Walter Hauser and Peter Stormare in the cast.Another film, is a dystopian thriller named Little America which is scheduled to film in California on 2020.\n\n\n== Production and effects companies ==\n\n\n=== Platinum Dunes ===\n\nBay founded production house Platinum Dunes with fellow producers Brad Fuller and Andrew Form in 2001.\n\n\n=== Digital Domain ===\n\nBay and Wyndcrest Holdings, a Florida-based investment firm, acquired the digital effects company Digital Domain from James Cameron and Stan Winston in 2006, infusing the struggling business with a $50 million investment. Digital Domain considered an initial public offering in 2009 but ultimately withdrew the offer, because of the lack of interest. The company was sold to Galloping Horse in 2012.\n\n\n=== The Institute ===\nAfter leaving Propaganda Films, Bay and producer Scott Gardenhour, also formerly at Propaganda, formed The Institute for the Development of Enhanced Perceptual Awareness (now known as The Institute), to produce commercials and other projects. Through The Institute, Bay has directed and produced spots for Victoria's Secret, Lexus, Budweiser, Reebok, Mercedes-Benz, and Nike. One of his Victoria Secret ads was for the 2009 \"A Thousand Fantasies\" holiday campaign.\n\n\n=== 451 Media Group ===\nBay co-founded 451 Media Group with Doug Nunes (who serves as CEO), and with John and Anthony Gentile, who previously marketed brands such as Micronauts, Visionaries, Sky Dancers and the Power Glove. In 2015, the company announced an interactive publishing division to offer \"augmented reality\" content from printed graphic novels with digital video. The graphic novels employ Touchcode technology from T+ink (previously used in the Power Glove), in which ink used in the printing process unlocks access to exclusive content that is housed on the Machinima Network, which is transferred to users' touch-screen-enabled mobile devices when the printed books are touched to those devices. The company's premiere slate of graphic novels was unveiled at the October 2015 New York Comic-Con. The creators involved included Scott Rosenberg, Skip Woods, George Pelecanos, Mark Mallouk, Clay McLeod Chapman and Peter and Paul Williams.\n\n\n=== Rogue Initiative ===\nIn June 2016, Bay joined The Rogue Initiative, a production studio and technology company, as a strategic advisor and stakeholder. The studio merges Hollywood production with interactive talent to generate story-driven content for games, mobile, virtual reality, mixed reality, television and feature film. As part of the partnership, Bay will develop and direct a multiplatform action-adventure game and cinematic VR experiences, based on an original IP conceived by him.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBay lives in Miami with his three English mastiffs, named for characters in his films. As a boy, he donated his Bar Mitzvah money to an animal shelter and often includes his dogs in his films. Bonecrusher appeared as Mikaela's dog \"Bones\" in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Mason, his first English mastiff, was named for John Patrick Mason, played by Sean Connery in The Rock. Mason appeared as Marcus' dog in Bad Boys II and as Miles' dog in Transformers. He died during production of the latter film in March 2007.Bay is not married and has no children. He previously dated sportscaster Lisa Dergan.In 2016 Bay owned a $50 million Gulfstream G550 jet, as well as a Bentley, a Range Rover, an Escalade, a Ferrari, a Lamborghini and two Camaros from the Transformers franchise.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Frequent collaborators ==\n\n\n=== Actors/actresses ===\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nDespite his box office success, Bay's work has been poorly received by film critics, and his name is often used pejoratively in art-house circles. Bay has responded to his critics, saying \"I make movies for teenage boys. Oh, dear, what a crime.\" Besides accusing him of making films that pander to a low demographic, critics and audiences have been critical of elements of Bay's filmmaking style such as the overuse of Dutch angles, rapid cutting, and clich\u00e9 camerawork. Other elements include extreme patriotism, juvenile humor, excessive product placement, oversaturated orange and teal color grading, reusing footage from his previous films, his refusal to make thought-provoking films, and his preference of action and spectacle over story and characters. Another point of contention with Bay's films is his portrayal and use of offensive racial stereotypes as comedic relief; a notable alleged example being the characters Skids and Mudflap in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.Bay has also been accused of heavily objectifying women in his films, with critics describing Bay's manner of filming actresses as \"lascivious\" and \"pornographic\". He has faced criticism for routinely making sexist remarks and showing female characters in a stereotypical light. He came under scrutiny for firing Megan Fox in retaliation after she made comments about him mistreating her on the set of the Transformers films and compared him to Hitler and Napoleon. Bay reportedly enlisted the crew of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to publish an open letter in his defense that referred to Fox as, among other things, \u201cMs. Sourpants,\u201d \u201cporn star,\u201d \u201cunfriendly bitch,\u201d and \u201cdumb-as-a-rock.\u201d In 2009, it was reported that Megan, at the age of 15, was made to wash Bay\u2019s car while auditioning for Transformers. In 2020, Fox revisited the incident and denied that she was underaged (for Transformers) or \u201cmade to 'wash' or work on someone's cars in a way that was extraneous from the materials in the actual script.\" However, Fox was 15 when she first appeared as a bikini-clad extra in the Bay film Bad Boys II.Actress Kate Beckinsale also spoke out publicly by reporting that she was body-shamed and regularly criticized for her appearance by Bay during the making of Pearl Harbor.Six of Bay's films have been nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Transformers: Age of Extinction, and Transformers: The Last Knight), with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen winning the \"award\".\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Institute\nMichael Bay on IMDb\nMichael Bay at AllMovie", "label": 0}

Tsang (Chinese: \u66fe\u6176\u9716; Pinyin: Zeng Qing-Lin) is an ophthalmologist and geneticist. He is currently an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology and an Associate Professor of Cell Biology and Pathology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, New York, in the United States.Tsang studies metabolic signaling in retinal diseases, as well as gene therapy and stem cell therapy to treat such diseases. In 2010, Tsang led an international research team that used embryonic stem cells of mice to replace diseased retinal cells in mice with retinitis pigmentosa to restore sight. In 2012, Tsang produced long term visual improvement in retinitis pigmentosa mouse models in two experiments, one using induced pluripotent stem cells and the other gene therapy. In 2015, Tsang was among the leaders of a team which discovered a gene mutation that can cause achromatopsia. In 2016, Tsang's team, in partnership with University of Iowa scientists, used the genome editing tool called CRISPR to repair a mutation that causes retinitis pigmentosa in patient derived stem cells. In 2018, Tsang and his team created a new technique for CRISPR, restoring function in the retina of mice affected by retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, Tsang contributes to scientific rigor with his service on the Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section at the NIH until 2018, and on the Scientific Advisory Panel of Research to Prevent Blindness until 2029.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTsang was born in British Hong Kong's Evangel Hospital \u64ad\u9053\u91ab\u9662.

She is the co-founder of the network 500 Queer Scientists.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEsposito was born and raised in El Paso, Texas. She kept a collection of insects in egg cartons, and her first grade science project looked at the Mendelian genetics of pigeon colours. Esposito earned her Bachelor's degree in biology at the University of Texas at El Paso in 2003. She became interested in scorpions during a National Science Foundation placement at the American Museum of Natural History. She moved to New York for her graduate studies. She completed her PhD at City University of New York and the American Museum of Natural History (Scorpion Systematics Research Lab) in 2011. Her dissertation, \"Systematics and Biogeography of the New World Scorpion Genus Centruroides Marx, 1890\", considered Buthidae scorpions.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\n\nIn 2011 she joined University of California, Berkeley as a postdoctoral researcher working on Caribbean scorpions. She studied the biogeography of arachnids. She joined the California Academy of Sciences in 2015, and is one of the world's only women scorpion experts. She continued to study buthidae scorpions at the California Academy of Sciences. She digitises and collects genetic information from the collected scorpion species. She is also working on arthropods in salt flats in western America. Her current research considers the evolution of scorpion venom and distribution of scorpions in the Caribbean. She has also studied the uses of scorpion venom in the context of cancer research and medication. In 2017 she discovered three new species and two new genera of club-tailed scorpions. She detected the scorpions using ultraviolet lights that excite a fluorescent dye in the scorpion armour. The new species were of the genus Rhopalurus Thorell. Whilst surveying the Penang Hill rainforest, Esposito identified a new ghost scorpion. In 2018 she identified that Centruroidinae scorpions hiss by rubbing themselves with comb like structures. She told Slate magazine that her favourite fact about scorpions was that they behave like mammals and bear live young.In 2014 Esposito was the co-founder of Islands & Seas, a non-profit that supports scientific research and education at its field station in Baja California Sur, Mexico. She leads educational programs in Baja California and at Columbia University. She is the creator of 500 Queer Scientists, a network of LGBTQ+ scientists worldwide. She created 500 Queer Scientists after a survey of American STEM workers identified that over 40% of LGBTQ+ scientists were not 'out' to their colleagues. She has appeared on Science Friday and Public Radio International. In February 2019 she was awarded the Walt Westman Award by the National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals (NOGLSTP) as recognition for the 500 Queer Scientists initiative. It is the highest national honor that NOGLSTP can award to a member, recognizing that individual's commitment to their mission.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLauren Esposito on Twitter", "label": 1}

{"name": "S. Akbar Zaidi", "department": "Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies", "course_descr": "This is an advanced undergraduate/graduate seminar course over fifteen weeks, designed to introduce upper level students to the study of South Asia as a region as a whole, as well as to countries which constitute it. We will examine the political economy of different countries, as well as the nature of their state, how society has evolved over the last six decades, and how the economy behaves and develops in a globalised world. The focus will be on trying to understand key themes which affect each of the main countries which constitute South Asia - themes such as politics and democracy, economic development, the state and society, and so on - as well as how the region has been affected as a whole.  With such great variety within South Asia - from having the world's largest democracy, to smaller countries which have been at war with their own people for years, or those which have relied more on the military than on civilians - we will also question whether there is at all a rationale for the term 'South Asia', itself. Is this just a convenient way of grouping countries which share some colonial antecedents, or does such a region actually exist? And if so, what does 'South Asia' mean in a globalised world increasingly made up of regional trading blocs? Hence, the course will examine, in a political economy framework, the internal workings in some of the countries of South Asia, as well as the region as a whole. This seminar course will try and provide a broad historical review of the nature of changes which have taken place in South Asia focussing on some key themes. The emphasis of the course will be on social and structural change and transformation, of society, the state and the economy of some of the countries, and of South Asia as a whole.\n", "wiki_title": "S.

{"name": "Elizabeth Bernstein", "department": "Women's and Gender Studies", "course_descr": "At once material and symbolic, our bodies exist at the intersections of multiple competing discourses, including the juridical, the techno-scientific, and the biopolitical. In this course, we will draw upon a variety of critical interdisciplinary literatures\u2014including feminist and queer studies, science and technology studies, and disability studies\u2014to consider some of the ways in which our bodies are both constituted by such discourses, and themselves serve as the substratum for social and political life. Our point of departure will be the precariousness of embodied existence, in which precarity is understood as both an existential condition and as the socially uneven culmination of neoliberal political and economic trends.\u00a0\u00a0Within the context of current pandemic crises relating to both public health and to political economy, we will also consider appeals to the beneficence of science, technology, medicine, and the rational governance of disease. What can critical histories of plagues, epidemics, and quarantines teach us about emergent forms of biopolitics? We will conclude by considering the interventions of contemporary disability and social justice activists, and the alternative possibilities that they have posited for self-care and mutual aid.\n", "wiki_title": "Elizabeth Bernstein", "wiki_page": "Elizabeth Bernstein (born 10 October 1968) is an American sociologist who is noted for her studies that focus on women, gender, and sexuality. She is also a professor at Columbia University's Barnard College.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBernstein completed her B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2001.\n\n\n== Works ==\nBernstein is particularly known for her research on sex work and the trafficking of women. In a study, for example, she suggested that sex work can be meaningful for both client and sex worker as it involves a particular form of emotional labor. This was explored in her book Temporarily Yours, which compiled decades of research involving prostitutes and observations made in brothels, police holding tanks, and after interviews with policymakers, and startups.She is also credited for introducing the term \"carceral feminism\", which advocates a stricter punishment for sex crimes such as prostitution and sex trafficking. This concept describes how feminist activists have collaborated with Christian evangelicals and the state systems of power to help women. Bernstein explained that this development has led to carceral paradigm of social justice as well as militarized humanitarianism. She criticized this phenomenon in a series of articles noting that the increased criminalization of sex work has disadvantaged people of color as these are the most likely arrested as its offenders.Aside from gender and sexuality, Bernstein's research and scholarship also focused on the sociology of law, the contemporary social theory as well as the link between the feminist, neoliberal, and evangelical Christian interests, including its role in contemporary U.S. policymaking concerning human trafficking. From 2007 to 2009, Bernstein worked with the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). She was part of the project Religion, Gender, and Politics, and completed several studies such as country research report on the United States and The Unhappy Marriage of Religion and Politics: Problems and Pitfalls for Gender Equality (2010).\n\n\n== Awards ==\nBernstein's work has been recognized by the National Science Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, American Association of University Women (AAUW), the Mellon Foundation, and the American Sociological Association.\n\n\n== References ==", "label": 1}
